We started this amazing event like everyone else, at mosswood park.
We arrived at the amphitheater around 7:10 pm and picked up our orange and green ribbons.
After talking with some fellow players and signing the waivers we listened to the briefing and began our journey.
Our first manuever to avoid the chasers was to jump a fence and take an alleyway behind Mosswood Park.
The alley was filled with awesome graffiti pretty plant-life.
As far as we know, no one else decided to go this way.
After jumping another fence we emerged near Pill Hill and proceeded down Webster St.
We turned onto 27th for about a block and then again onto Harrison.
We took the Harrison fork onto Orange, followed it up to MacArthur and crossed under the freeway near the paintings of the giraffes.
From there we cut into residential streets.
On Chetwood we had our first encounter with a chaser.
Luckily as we started to run back up the hill he was reluctant to follow.
An older man in an apartment opened his window asked us if we wanted a clue for the second checkpoint.
He told us that there was a pathway from Alta Vista between houses leading all the way down to Grand.
We made note of this as we continued to the first stop.
Near the entrance to the stop we joined up with two other players, whose names slip my mind.
We made it to the first checkpoint in the awesome rose garden.
The garden was extremely beautiful and we resolved to check it out again on another day.
We met up with the gypsies and then journeyed on.
Using the tip the man on Chetwood gave us we found the path between houses and followed it all the way to Grand.
We didn't encounter any other players on our way.
A few steps on to Grand a chaser jumps out of a cafe and takes down one of our party.
Karson and I jumped down a side street and as far as we could tell, were not followed.
We found a freeway overpass which led to a school.
We could see the Grand Lake from the school, which meant we were close.
We hopped the fence to get out of the school and made our way to checkpoint #2.
Here we had our pictures taken with a lovely man in a dress.
We took his picture as well.
There we met up with our other team member and continued up a hill into a residential neighborhood attempting to avoid the chasers on lakeside.
We succeeded and saw no other players the whole way down to 18th street.
From 18th street we could see the Parkway Cinema, previous home of our Rocky Horror cast.
Horrible things awaited us at the lemonade stand in Athol Park.
Here I encountered my arch-nemesis, the durian fruit.
Not only does it smell like a rotting corpse, it also tastes like some kind of mix between mayonaise, guacamole, and artificial sweetener.
You can guess the texture.
Vile, vile fruit.
After this horror show, we drank our lemonade and ventured onto 2nd street.
From here we cut down to Peralta Park and through Laney College.
We proceeded directly into the 9th st.
safe-zone, without seeing any chasers.
While there, we both defeated the minotaur and even took a picture with her.
Theseus don't got shit on us.
We doubled back to Laney and got lost trying to get around the freeway.
We tried to cut through what we thought was an office complex.
We were unpleasantly surprised to find out that this was no office building.
Suddenly there was a flashlight in our eyes and a command to turn around.
It seemed we had stumbled into the police station.
He searched my backpack and demanded to know what we were doing out there.
We told him we were playing a game and I showed him my manifest.
He mistook \journey\' for geocaching.'
After everything was cleared up they allowed us to go with a warning to be safe.
They seemed genuinely worried and suggested we carry a weapon ( pepperspray, namely).
We then ventured down the Embarcadero, encountering absolutely no one.
We started to become confused as to where the 5th location actually was ( the map looks like it is across the water).
Luckily we ran into the umbrella people (the mobile safe-zone).
They pointed us in the right direction and we found two seemingly identical scenes at the pier.
After finding the 12 differences, we had a conversation with the two girls at the checkpoint and learned that the next checkpoint had been slightly moved from its original location.
We then continued up Washington to 10th st.
From 10th street, we found the next checkpoint.
Karson and myself told the man two equally horrible jokes and recieved a stamp.
From there, we walked from 12th street to Harrison and took Harrison all the way to the entrance to Fairyland.
The final checkpoint was at the gazebo and we arrived as #46 out of 258, around 12:25 am.
We recieved our green badges, said goodbye to everyone, and walked back to Mosswood Park.
Our journey was conducted purely on foot, no public transportation was used.
We had an excellent and will take the opportunity to do it again.
Hello everyone-- My name is Aaron Vanderbeek.
I'm new to the bay area and am currently working at Electronic Arts / Visceral Games as a game designer.
I had an incredible time Journeying to the end of the Night and thought I'd share my experience with you all!
I had heard of the Journey to the End of the Night after chasing cryptids in downtown San Francisco.
A flyer made its way into my hands that described an event that when described sounded like preparation for a zombie infestation.
Having enjoyed that rather vigorous experience of running with intent through city blocks I found myself drawn to the Journey.
I met my good friend Paul at the start of the Journey and anxiously waited with the 200+ other runners for the call to finally start running.
We tied on each others' green ribbons, analyzed the map, and talked some strategy.
Paul had been reading about players' past experiences on the Journey where he basically learned that slow and steady is generally the way to go.
Then and there we planned to take long sweeping routes, off the beaten path, and to conserve our energy for when we needed quick bursts of speed to get away from chasers.
We also realized that our lack of knowledge about the public transit and the uselessness of the BART would make this entirely a foot-race for us.
THE START
We started immediately by running in somewhat of the wrong direction, as we had been holding our map at the wrong angle.
Thank goodness the pack was there to guide us and show us the correct way :) We attempted to stay true to our plan of staying off the direct routes but found ourselves on Monte Vista, where we encountered our first chaser, on a bicycle.
She did not make a strong attempt to pursue us as we inferred that the chasers would not try to get people out that diligently until later in the game.
Still, on Monte Vista we encountered two more chasers, both times sending Paul and I, and the other half-dozen or so people into the bushes on the uphill climb.
We took our time, waiting for chasers to move away from our location and proceeded at a leisurely walk up the hill.
Once at the top we thought to take the direct road to the checkpoint, Vernon, but a chaser pushed us back up the hill.
Once there, a chaser coming from behind pushed us down Oakland Ave.
While we were getting sufficiently out-positioned, the chasers were definitely taking it easy on us.
Still, we were being chased.
I saw some people running down a side slope off of Oakland and made the gut decision to follow them down the steep dirt path along the side of a building.
I call out to Paul, who was running ahead of me and hoped he could double back before the chaser arrived there.
He did, and we proceeded to the first checkpoint at the Ampiteatre of Roses.
HE'S ACTUALLY CHASING ME
We settle down and check the time.
We got to the checkpoint around 7:45, thirty minutes before closing time.
Intending on widening that gap, we were hoping to make it to the next checkpoint rather quickly.
Heading to the very top of the Ampitheatre we found ourselves on a side street between Jean and Vernon.
At the corner of Santa Rosa, we encounter a chaser.
This was not like the other chasers.
He fully intended to capture each and every one of us if he could.
I remember actually being shocked at how badly it seemed he wanted to tag us.
I had to sprint to get away from him.
My strategy when being chased is to go back to known safe places, usually right from where I came from.
So naturally I run right back to the safe zone I just left.
From the corner of my eye I see Paul perform exactly the opposite strategy he does a quick juke and then runs forward, a more efficient use of running energy.
I sit in the safe zone for about five minutes, but the chaser remains camped outside the checkpoint, forcing me to find another path.
Paul and I agree to reunite at the 3rd checkpoint, so neither of us would have to wait in the danger zones.
So I go all the way down the hill and end up on Grand Avenue, a large wide open restaurant/business district that was a direct route to the checkpoint.
While dangerous, I was able to tag along with a couple guys that I would effectively use as bait/chaser detection to aid me on such a dangerous route.
I walked with them, but tended to stay closer to the street and a little back from them.
We walked together and keenly eyed the many pedestrians on the street.
There were many people, but none of them seemed to be chasers.
We saw one chaser run by on the other side of the street, but it seemed he was not chasing anyone but rather just running somewhere.
It was a rather uneventful stretch (thankfully).
I see Paul at the corner of Santa Clara and run to catch up with him.
It seems he's made some friends as well, and we observantly make our way to the checkpoint with no real issues.
DETOUR
The 2nd checkpoint was.
interesting.
The main in the dress was definitely not wearing underwear, and he wanted to take my photo.
If you aren't going to tuck at least put some briefs on :)  
Anyway, Paul and I and our new friends Jessie and Jesper seek out an exit from the 2nd checkpoint, but find chasers to be camped at all of the possible eastern outlets.
Not anxious to head into shark infested waters we take a look at the map and decide that it would be worth it to go around the lake in the other direction.
It would be about double/triple the distance but there would be no chasers so it would be totally worth it.
About one third of the way on our journey around the lake and we figure out that we have to cross checkpoint 4 to get to 3, where we will undoubtedly be encountering many chasers going from 3 to 4.
Despite acknowledging our egregious error we continue onward with the plan basking in the current void of chasers at our current location.
Our concerns were indeed true.
As we crossed checkpoint four, we found there were not many channels of movement around the southern point of the lake.
We encounter a chaser on the bridge who comes at us in full sprint.
I again use the run to safety plan, and our group scatters.
The chaser pursues me over three blocks during which I run through traffic twice to try to use moving vehicles to my advantage.
He makes a very admirable chase but eventually cries out \YOU WIN\'.'
I hurry back to where I left my group and don't see them immediately.
I begin to cross the bridge again, but I see another chaser.
He spots me and starts up in a jog and I assume my friends are on the lakeside sidewalk which runs below the bridge.
I run in that direction until I spot them, all three of them are tying on their orange ribbons.
Realizing I am totally alone now, I bolt backwards again jumping across a highway median to reach safety at Oak and 10th.
I sit on the corner for about 5 minutes and try to figure out a new plan.
ALL ALONE :(
While I was very sad that I had to play alone for a long while, I at least had the benefit of being more mobile.
Hopefully this would make me go through the race a bit faster.
I definitely had a lot of ground to cover and I was actually worried about getting to the third checkpoint before it closed.
At this point it was getting dark.
I decide to go directly up 10th, walking.
It is my intention to take 10th St to 4th Ave to the safezone at 18th.
As I suspected, I encounter a couple chasers walking from checkpoint 3 to 4.
Curse this freakin' detour.
I see them from afar so I casually cross the street and head into Channel Park.
I try to hide behind a small structure, but their curiously leads them into the park after me and I am forced to run.
The only exit is across a small one-lane bridge about 50 yards ahead of me as I was flanked by very tall chain-link fences and a building.
I move towards the bridge when another chaser comes off the bridge!
I am totally surrounded.
I look behind me at the two chasers, spreading themselves out so as to block the large entrance to the park, and then back to the chaser in front of me who came off of the bridge and ran towards me.
I   run to the side and then do a quick juke to the other side and find myself behind the chaser from the bridge, free to run across it to safety.
They do not pursue.
Thinking back, they could have easily caught me had he just stayed on the bridge.
I find my way out of the park and back onto 10th where I encounter another runner.
We exchange chaser information and head on our differing paths.
I stick to my plan, and take 4th all the way to 18th where I am safe until the 3rd checkpoint.
I manage to spin a free pass and am not required to eat anything.
I scoped out what they had though as I was actually really hungry, but settle on just the lemonade.
Ahhhh, refreshing.
It was at this checkpoint where I realized that there were more chasers hanging out than runners, which was not a pleasant sight for me.
I check my watch, and it's already 9:20.
CABIN FEVER and DARKNESS
I feel like I'm pretty far behind in the race but still feel like I should stay off the beaten path so I can recuperate some energy on this leg.
My plan is to take 18th to 5th Ave to 7th St, go through the park and come around the backside of checkpoint 4.
I think about Paul and wonder if he is actually chasing people and what would happen if we saw each other.
So I set out on my journey, feeling extraordinarily paranoid.
It's dark, I'm alone, I'm walking through a not-so-decent neighborhood, and I'm scoping everyone out for orange ribbons.
This leg was rather uneventful though.
I think I was pretty far behind, but I didn't see a single chaser the whole way from 3 to 4.
When I passed the river in the park I made out some people on the river bank looking at a cellphone but did not ascertain whether or not they were even playing the game.
My hyper-paranoia had me hiding in the blackness of shade for about 3 minutes before I decide to bolt across the bridge in the park.
Nothing came of it, so I relaxed and continued my walk to checkpoint 4.
GROUP COVER and UMBRELLA SIGHTINGS
I do the minotaur maze thing and tell them my favorite word is 'chipmunk'.
That is so not my favorite word, but for some reason that's what came out.
I look at my map and realize that the next safe zone is only 6 blocks away and decide the best course of action is to beeline for it.
After getting chased back to checkpoint 4 by chasers camping outside on nearby blocks I am forced to reconsider my plan.
There is a very large group waiting at the bus stop, intending to take the bus west, dropping them directly in the intersection of checkpoints 4, 5, and 6.
I considered joining them, but decided it was too dangerous compared to just going south to the safe zone.
I tag along with a group of 6 that is jogging down Oak towards 2nd St.
The group simultaneously spots three chasers two blocks ahead and a red umbrella one block ahead and one to the right, and they all decide to book it for the umbrella.
The chasers take note and chaser after them.
Both the group and the chasers careen down 5th St, leaving me standing there alone.
I continue straight on Oak and make it to the safe zone on 2nd.
I walk down 2nd, reading the map trying to figure out my best entry to the 5th checkpoint, not really understanding if everything south of 2nd was really a safe zone or not, and what roads actually went to this waterfront commercial district.
A couple chasers ran up to me and tagged me, when I informed them we were in a safe zone.
They looked rather dejected and told me they were following me for 4 blocks.
Oh well.
I eventually find the 5th checkpoint, where another group of runners is already consuming all of the goodies associated with the puzzle.
I also do my fair share of chomping on a handful of cookies and MandMs while figuring out the solution to the puzzle, not fully realizing how hungry I was until that moment.
This group that was at the checkpoint with me, about 5 or 6 strong, caught a ride with the red umbrella to the next checkpoint while I was still solving the puzzle.
Again I felt very behind.
TIME TO CATCH UP and BELLHOPS
When I finally finished the puzzle, the kind woman at the checkpoint informed me about the phone booth and sent me on my way.
I make the fated decision to bolt on the most direct path to checkpoint 6, about 10 blocks down Broadway.
I'm actually running this entire portion, hoping that most of the chasers will be tired and not be that much of a challenge.
I know that I can make this checkpoint in less than 10 minutes so I'll feel pretty good about my chances if I make it to the checkpoint.
I almost run into two chasers, walking away from me on my block, but I am able to stop short and hide behind some parked vehicles.
I wait for them to continue to the next block and cross the street.
I move one block to Franklin where I continue to run, but again see more chasers.
I go back to Broadway to avoid being noticed and continue forward.
Two chasers across the street see me, but traffic is keeping me safe for now.
I make the blunder of running forward on Broadway, allowing them to keep pace with me down the street when I should have just moved one block away our of their sight range.
Traffic clears and they make the pursuit in full sprint.
I run away from Broadway, away from checkpoint 6.
I run through stopped traffic and on the sidewalks and one of them is inching closer and closer to me.
No one in the game has continued the pursuit with me for so long I'm beginning to think this is the end.
I decide my only was out of this situation is to be reckless and cut sideways into the street, doubling back toward Broadway.
I think the move surprised the chaser as he didn't keep up with me once I turned around.
One of the pursuers that had given up earlier was now in front of me however and I was forced to run towards him slightly to get around a street corner.
He was not as fast as me and eventually gave up.
Once I had lost them I slowed to a walk to catch my breath.
The people on the sidewalk were definitely wondering why I was breathing so heavily, and I think an officer really wanted to ask me if I was ok, but I just kept moving forward.
I look at my phone to check the time and see a message from my friend Paul, who was at the final checkpoint: \Winner?'
Aaron
At the time I was angry at the turn of events, getting caught in that manner, being so close to the checkpoint, physically and emotionally drained, and wanted to have nothing to do with the people that caught me, but they were adamant in getting me to see the silver lining of the situation.
So adamant that I forgot about the whole phone booth mechanic that would have brought me right back into the game, located 1 block from where I was caught.
POST MORTEM
I walk with my captors to checkpoint 7, on the lookout for runners.
Had I seen one I would have assuredly run after them, but am glad that I didn't as my body was beginning to feel the effects of what I had just done over the course of the last 3.
I meet up with Paul at the final check point, and the first winner arrives shortly after.
Again, Paul and I discuss strategy more specifically we analyze our experience and figure out where we went wrong.
Strategically we felt like it would have been better to go faster on the first two checkpoints, to stay ahead of the pack that would become a pack of chasers, so we would be less likely to run into chasers further down the road.
Also, the direct routes almost never seem like the best idea.
It doesn't take that much more time to find a parallel road but it probably has fewer chasers on it, if any.
And when encountering chasers it seems like running to safety is a better strategy than trying to run forward into unknown territory.
It is very good to use the other runners around you as bait or for information gathering.
I definitely felt most safe when I was running in a group of people I didn't know.
It is very difficult to maintain a large group of people as well, and attaching yourself to groups of 3+ will definitely make you move more slowly in the game.
The Journey is amazingly fun.
It is simple and elegant, and people on the street get excited to see what you are doing.
It has a brilliant narrowing focus built in that creates a seemingly overwhelming obstacle, that has the potential for great fulfillment in achieving it.
I applaud and thank the organizers of the event for working so hard to put on an absolutely wonderful game for 200+ people and having it run smoothly.
I'm looking forward to next year :)  No Bellhops this time please.
\As if I knew where I was going
And I must apologize to the player I spooked so bad near the fallback wall street checkpoint, coming up Broadway, that he ran smack into the wall of some bank, cowering, a shockingly memorable look of terror contorting his face.
Personal Terrorism is totally the next shit.
I didn't think to tag him, but offered my hands to help pull the kid off the street.
He didn't take them.
From the Battery beacon I made my way on foot up to chinatown, Nicol my Robinson and I hers, we constantly reappeared at each other's side.
Lower Manhattan was a player killing fields, very few escaped untagged.
Eventually I gave up searching and walked, strangely exultant, up to the final checkpoint.
Everyone was out, Friday late on the Lower East Side, and the game had let me just loose enough to really enjoy one last epic traipse through the city.
S'how it was.
Celine is right:
\Just plain living

And that's THE END!
By the way - who, if any one, noticed the theme for the checkpoints?
In an earlier Era, there used to be this task.
It turns out that annaone, Loki and Spidere did that with me as the guinea pig.
An emergency situation allright.
And I'm alone,  see?
Hey, Ben made a logo and all, but the whole MXZero is me.
And of course I said ohboy-hell-yes!
And Journey did indeed happen.
Organization, you say?
Well, Dax gave me tons of advice.
And Spidere-The-Legendary-Journey-Maker gave me access to his wikis, files, checklists, maps and budgets.
You guys have no idea.
A true JTTEOTN for Dummies.
Step by step fool-proof.
But now, how much of that did I actually followed?
Â´Cause there is this thing called I'm-not-in-the-same-league-as-you-guys-are-in-terms-of-networking-and-people-here-doesnÂ´t-really-function-like-that?
Â´Cause he's smart and I'm dumb and there is nothing I can do about it?
Maybe too.
BUT, against all disorganizational odds, there was a webpage and a Facebook group and a Facebook event and mailing-lists-of-likeminded-people that were thoroughly informed of the event.
I honestly doubt that any of that helped much.
But there were also flyers pasted to trees and bus stops and University halls and bulleting boards.
And word of mouth, in both the old-fashioned actually-talking-on-the phone kind and email versions.
I think those worked nicely, with a low batting average, but still.
In any case, the meta-narrative of the whys and hows of Journey success in such and such social settings are not really my thing: I'm sure the scholars will go through it if it happens to be of any interest.
What I really want to say about Journey, in this oh-so-generous-space that SSI had being kind enough to grant me (I mean, a real, official, 45 point task!
) is what appears on the notes I scribbled the day after Journey.
Spidere's hug at the airport and sunrise: sleep deprived and yet extremely happy time.
Serious chase: injury, danger, Stockholm syndrome.
SFZero royalty eyes: so beautiful gree/blue/green but realy more than color the spark, the warmth.
Painfully clear this split-life of mine, this explanation about schizophrenia and SF0 saving my life.
-Luis: awesome smiling lead runner, mountain climber.
-Oliver: brought lots of people
-Stories!
Routes, ribbons slipping, faces
-Diana saving the night
And really, what can be put fully in words, that if Journey is possible to come together as it did then I really could actually turn my life around, defend it
-My kids the dog, I wonder who did they see standing there and talking to people
-The white Tyvek suit.
Becoming susy who is bold and brave and even awesome.
Skipping rocks, telling Loki and anna one what to do (!
-And susy found the right tone, right words for the ones that showed up, we locals are this way
-The failures that didnÂ´t much matter and the end: bonus checkpoint, clues.
-Police officer talked into signing manifests.
Buy scouts volunteering to.
-A party of doing, strange Â´cause we were each alone and blocks away, Thomas even out os reach by phone, and yet everybody doing the right thing, movements balancing out, everything working out at the very last minute
-That was JourneyMX for you, SF0: the most unlikely materializing by love and crazy trust.
I truly love you guys.
(Oh, you came here looking for actual Journey documentation?
Um, OK, here, have a video.
I have no idea if it works at all for people that wasnÂ´t there, or for people that was, really.
But hey, it does it for me: from scouting to I-canÂ´t-believe-we-did-it-holy-cow-it worked-total-strangers-showed-up-and-everyone-was-really-having-so-much-fun!
Maybe it is worth to say that I'm primarily HC after all?
As a disclaimer of sorts?
Anyway, it was beyond great.
I do have crazy friends, lucky me.
Thanks to all).

The Animus:  Becoming a checkpoint agent really changes the way you view the game.
Case in point: Whereas my initial will was to have every player fail and be caught, seeing them come through against all odds, panting, crumpled manifest in hand, I developed a soft spot for them.
I helped them find a way out of checkpoint 4 (or tried to, at least).
I gave them advice and strategies, offering a vague idea I had of chaser movements.
I congratulated them, I cheered them on.
What got into me?
I could make this write-up a list of all the blunders I made that day: breaking the sunglasses I was supposed to wear, forgetting that parking meters shut off at 9 PM, forgetting quarters for said parking meters, forgetting to give Kyle his bag (about 4 or 5 times), forgetting to eat, giving the first players bad directions -- though, in my defense, Google Maps should be more accommodating for streets hiding under overpasses.
Also, you surprised the fuck out of me --, causing others to bleed when I signed body parts in lieu of manifests, bringing pens that don't work, not bringing my camera, walking through an area I clearly should not have walked through trying to find the finish line from my parking spot --.
It could go on forever.
The highlights, however, are very simple -- I was in great company the entire night from what I hear, we had one of the coolest-looking checkpoints (Chinatown ftw!
Going back with my camera very soon) the player/chaser dynamic was fucking epic at this (check)point in the game: since it was accessible from virtually any angle, chasers learned to camp a corner, and players learned to sneak in from the least-protected angle (usually behind us).
When Kyle, a staff chaser, came to lock up his bike early in the game, I found it incredibly awkward that a player was in our checkpoint with him.
Little did I know that this activity was going to be commonplace for the rest of the night.
My first interaction with players was amusing.
Here I am, enjoying my people-watching, completely lost in my own mind, and I notice someone pop into view that seemed a little exhausted.
They look directly towards me, expectantly, and I try not to stare back out of consideration.
Then I see the blue ribbon.
Oh, right, hey, she's looking for me.
Then I realized it was a good 15 minutes before I was supposed to expect players, and my checkpoint partner hadn't even shown up yet.
I'm sure the confused look on my face didn't encourage her at all.
But then I remembered my strat 
\Fuck!'
Second place showed up and I decided to quiz her as well.
Yellow can't be anagrammed!
\
 it took them under a minute to come up with that.'
They were fucking prepared to win.
I let them go after giving slightly-off directions, and 5 minutes later, I got a call from Checkpoint 5 about my folly.
Thanks for biting my head off, Lisa.
:: grins ::
ZeroGee joined me after they left, and together we watched a few more runners come through unharmed.
I distinctly remember our checkpoint becoming a hotspot for chasers before the 11th player came through, because I was helping #10 look for a way out despite all the pink traffic.
I was thinking \Hey

anna
In pairs, we would then separate them.
Separately, we would ask each the question: knowing that something bad is going to happen, you have a choice you can either make things harder for yourself and easier for your partner.
or you can make things easier for you and harder for them.
The question gets at the heart of one's pride and selfishness.
The results are as follows:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â  B is Nice Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  B Betrays
 A is Nice Â Â  Each: one small bellÂ Â Â   Â Â  Runner A: one large bell
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â   Â Â Â  Runner B: no bells
 
A BetraysÂ  Runner A: no bellsÂ Â Â Â   Â  Â  Â Â  Each: two small bells
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Runner B: one large bell
We didn't make the payoffs clear to the runners--but we did set this up as a proper Prisoner's Dilemma: the best overall outcome is to each have one small bell, which makes a very soft noise.
Two bells are fairly jangly, and the large ones make some real noise when you run.
And if you have no bells, they make no noise at all.
The interesting aspect of the Prisoner's Dilemma is this: although together, the runners would like to get to the one small bell, one small bell outcome, it is nonetheless in each individual runner's interest to make it easier on themself.
If your partner is being \nice\' and making it harder for themself
If they are \betraying\' and making it harder for you
Thus, no matter what the other person is doing, it is always better for you personally to make it harder on them.
Because of this, it seems like the only rational outcome is that both players betray (make it easier for themself).
Sidenote: I love the Prisoner's Dilemma.
The fact that it's a game where it is always in your interest to act badly, a Nash equilibrium which seems impossible to escape, and yet, by the iterated nature of it, permits cooperation as an optimal strategy!
A game which serves as analogy for so many useful things, which has had years of study through populations of computer programs and business students, a parable and a rich vein of analytic insights.
I love it.
-S
All of this said, there were some surprising outcomes.
Not so surprising (to Spidere, at least) was the fact that most pairs of players were nice to each other.
Despite the rational arguments, most people seem to take it as a point of pride to make things worse for them, and a point of fairness not to harm the other person for their own benefit.
Not to mention, if you are running with this person, you don't want things to be worse for them (since this will result in it being harder for you as well).
What was interesting, though, was that this still seemed to hold when people were arbitrarily paired up.
While a couple of people said, \I don't know that person--make it harder for them.'
While the first player got a big bell just for being in the lead, and Herbie Hatman got one just for being Herbie, we also allowed them to answer the question \Do you want to make it harder for the next person
Almost everyone said make it easier for the next person to come along, someone they didn't know and were running against in this race.
Almost everyone.
anna one started out attempting to document the runner's names, their choices and the outcomes, but note taking got abandoned entirely in jumble after our checkpoint was shut down.
The notes, such as they are, read something like this:
Aaron, 1st runner.
nice- big bell (individual)
Carlito, 2nd runner 
David.
Alex, pipecleaner
Zach, individual, not nice
James, nice

Chase, betray
Kristine, nice/nice
Danielle, nice/?
Brian, nice
Now then, intimate details of the Prisoner's Dilemma aside, it seems to me (anna one) that it might be important to fill in the rest of the story, and especially to point out that 
A- our checkpoint was on the 9th floor rooftop of a parking garage
B- the most obvious way to get to the rooftop was to take the elevator, which was 
C- positioned directly in front of the building's security and cashier's office.
That being said, we focused our attention from the outset on a checkpoint which wouldn't require much to move for when we inevitably got kicked out.
Which we did, after those first 33 or so people, documented in my notes above.
Actually, originally, the friendly security guard told us that the top floor of the garage was reserved for the Hertz rental staff for the whole night, but that we could continue to run our game on the 7th floor, which was public parking.
By this point Rabbit had arrived to see if we needed any help, and Spidere asked him to go down the elevator to wrangle runners attempting to come up, and let them know the new arrangement.
Meanwhile, Spidere and I finished with the last remaining people we already had in line, packed up our bells and zipties and drove down to the 7th floor.
By the time we got down to the 7th floor, I'm not sure whether we had direct information from the lobby, or just a bad feeling, but repositioning our checkpoint inside the building just felt like asking for trouble.
Spidere got out to take the elevator down, while I drove the long, circular ramp to the street.
On the ground floor, the security guards were yelling at runners, and had set up a system to check for parking ticket stubs before letting anyone into the building.
Rabbit had runners lining up along Mason St.
and waiting.
And waiting, because in our rush, we hadn't thought to send Spidere down in the elevator with bells.
And waiting some more, because not only is the parking lot the only parking downtown, the one way streets converge at Mason and O'Farrell in such a way that a trip around the block is actually more like seven blocks.
It took me a while to get the bells to the boys.
I understand that at this point, Rabbit and Spidere just threw bells onto runners as fast as possible, with little or no explanation.
By the time I arrived back from finding parking, the massive crowd of runners was mostly gone, and Spidere and I swung back into our rehearsed routine.
By the end of the night, we'd gone through approximately 148 runners: 28 got big noisy bells, 27 got two small bells, 74 got a single tiny bell, and 19 received a sparkly, white, totally silent pipecleaner.
NOTE: If any SFÃ?ian has a need or want for a few hundred jingle bells, large and small, or pipecleaners, or even big, black 14\ zipties
\
 but this year I was a runner.'
I ran through places I had never seen and didn't know were there.
I saw the city's skyline from angles that were new to me.
I found out there's graffiti at the base of the cliffs along River Road west.
I discovered that even in the middle of a Saturday evening, standing in a part of the city I haven't been in for 15 years, I am still connected - a student of mine (not a part of the game) drove by and hung out the window to yell my name!
We started at Tower Hill park.
I came on my own but quickly glommed on to others that I knew (Oliver X, Star5, Ink Tea, et al.
), hoping for solidarity and wisdom since I know that I am a car driver, not a foot runner and therefore my ability to navigate would be limited.
We began with a dash across University Avenue and then a walk down train tracks.
Suddenly I felt like I was in a disaster movie, trying to avoid roving gangs wearing too much football armor painted black.
Our path to the second checkpoint was roundabout and lovely since it went down by the river.
I've crossed the river on I-94 twice a day most days of the last few years, but I had never walked under it.
We walked through a neighborhood that should be in a \bad\' part of town
We cut through the old projects that are still questionable, and found that the city has spent some effort cleaning and beautifying.
I found a light rail station by foot instead of just riding through it.
I made it through 4 of the 7 checkpoints, but my confusion about where the 5th checkpoint was led to my capture!
Gwen and I were hiding in plain sight - walking with exiting Orchestra Hall audience members - trying to spy where the checkpoint was.
Former friends and allies were circling like piranha.
We ducked into a building alcove.
We hid between two parked busses - while the driver stared down at us!
Eventually, my own folly was my downfall.
Spying a chaser, I inadvertently said his name out loud (Danger D.
Hotbod) - suddenly I was on his radar.
I ran into the street (yes, I actually did look both ways).
Knowing I couldn't outrun him, I started running in circles - in the middle of the street, with a crowd of Orchestra Hall onlookers.
His giggles and cries of \What are you doing?'
I joined the other chasers and we began our hunt.
Footsore and aching, I chased a few but eventually retired to the after-party to congratulate those who made it and celebrate with everyone.
While running, I indulged in some meta-awareness.
Some day I will tell stories to my daughter about doing this.
I hope to encourage her to do these things as well.
I want her to grow up being told, \Not tonight honey - Mommy's got to go have an adventure.'
I have a family, I have tons of commitments.
But I will go out and run through the night!
____________end of Windelina's line___________
Dear friends,
It is your old pal Inky here.
This was my third Journey, having manned a checkpoint in Chicago once, and acted as Bike Chaser here in Minneapolis last year.
I'll admit that I had some serious doubts as to my abilities as a player, so until I'd done the other tasks in a satisfactory manner, I didn't \man up\' and face the terror of running
But: armed with a crew of friends, I found myself relaxed back into the follower/documentary mode- listening and watching, of course, but putting little work into paying attention where we were going or strategizing how we'd get there.
We took circuitous routes to checkpoints one and two and three, seeing only one chaser on our way to the Franklin Bridge, one on the edge of Burn Unit's park, and finally becoming too relaxed as we made our way to the fifth checkpoint.
Danger and I were walking out front and when we rounded a corner found ourselves face to face with a chaser- I dashed to a bus shelter, barely missed, but Danger had been caught and I was split from the team, who all touched a single bus stop pole across the street.
Danger's chaser quit the game, and I looked sadly at Danger, who stood now wearing a pink armband, between me and the rest of my runner team.
We stood there for a few minutes, and eventually I made a dash for my team, and Danger caught me.
And then began my life as a chaser.
Chaser Inky is a different beast than runner Inky.
Chaser Inky is an urban predator, willing to run with a pack of predators, or go off on her own, should matters call for it.
Chaser Inky is keen-eyed.
Chaser Inky will not remember to take photographs.
Danger and I left the scene of the deaths of our green armbands and our friends, who still huddled around the one pole which served as their safe zone.
But we were soon to see them again, as they didn't end up taking the bus they'd intended.
Chaser Inky spied the tip of a head peek behind a corner, and our former loyalties to our friends were gone.
I tagged Star5, who was huddled behind a car.
We'd also served to split the group into even smaller pieces.
I spied and stalked Olly a bit, Danger caught Windy, and soon the four of us were walking again.
I spied the tip of another head behind a door column, and another behind a bush.
We chased down another group, and one girl  made a wrong turn into a parkinglot with no back exit, and a shiny mirrored building behind her reflecting her image as she crouched behind a van.
Her armband was soon mine, and I rejoined my crew as we headed downtown.
Star5 and Danger took First Ave, and Windy and I stalked Nicollet before we stopped in on the final checkpoint.
At this point I had two armbands and some reserve energy (probably from freebasing EmergenC), so Windy and I set out again down Second Ave N.
I saw a friend and his crew, and set off running after them, down the street and then up towards the skyways- when trying to figure out where they'd gone, I saw the slightest tip of a head duck behind a pillar down on the street level, ran down and across the street between cars, trying to be quiet.
When I reached the pillar I knew there was more than one behind it, so I leapt at them swiping what ended up being three runners in one arm's swing.
I retrieved the armbands and left them to tie on their own chaser bands as I went trying to figure out where my friend and his runner pals had gone.
(They'd booked it through the skyways and were long gone, and besides, I hear tell that you can only carry 200lbs of buffalo meat back to the wagon.
)  I'd lost Windy, who was no longer answering her phone, reconnected with Danger and Star5, and stalked a couple streets more before returning to the final checkpoint, and eventually making our way to the afterparty.
I won a lovely trophy, as I'd apparently caught more runners than anyone else, soaked my feet in the hot tub, and felt that having caught the end of the night, that it was well worth all the travel.
Your vegan friend is an urban predator.
Love,
Inky

One of my friends who is not on SF0 and has stated their intentions not to join up did make this map to map their progress:  http://bit.

Poetry-Postscript:
Journey to the End of the Poem
I forget the city like you forget the air
like you forget the sidewalk
like you forget your feet
and I am dancing with my quarry.
Saturday night and the city is beanstalk heels
and fairy skirts in line for one club or another-
no one notices the wolf in the woods.
I forget the warnings they give girls in the city
stay out of alleyways
stick to the paths you know,
but I am more dog than girl now,
a pink ribbon on my arm
signifies my femininity
less than my wild wind-whipped hair.
I see you behind a pillar and I wave.
You are a quivering rabbit in a bush,
hello bunny, I smile.
Give me the stairs and bushes, 
parkinglots and busy streets,
I see you mirrored in the glass wall of the building, bunny.
crouching behind a parked van.
I see you across the street, bunny.
I am a girl with legs that forget groaning muscles
like I forget being alone
like I forget being broke
like I forget anything but finding a fish in this stream.
I am sober among drunks
shuffling like the sleepwalkers
will you see me before I break ranks to chase you.
Bunny, fawn, dove, green-ribboned up the stairs.
I am a warning shot fired into the crowd,
you are glass shattered, your friends scattered,
I want your ribbon in my pocket.
I want you to switch the light-switch on the moon
howl with me.
Forget your feet.
After having run in Vienna, and having been caught in Budapest, the logical third is to organize a Journey.
Together with the fellow sf0 members riot (aka the argency), lyx and many other great people we have been doing just that.
In Berlin.
I apologize in advance to anyone who enjoyed my narrative after the other Journeys.
This praxis feels so much more like a continuous piece of work than a single event, and I have no clue how to translate that into a single short story.
It was amazing.
I would do it again.

The event
proof:6, size:50, align:center
I flew to Berlin to meet my fellow creature of the night, lyx.
Lack of coordination made us take a taxi to the start point to deploy supplies, while the rest of the crew was meeting and preparing in the c-base space station.
proof:8, size:50, align:center
Soon after us (and the telltale sign we set up), people started gathering, and we were greeted by a local TV station and a radio crew.
We left the initiations to Vortex, ninin and riot and headed for the strategic points.
For reference and perusal:
My own map
Marenz' map (one of the runners who has taken the time to create a map!
)
Start: Tiergarten park.
(known for hosting the Victory column, the Reichstag and the Love parade)
I was mostly trolling the bridge on the largest and most direct path towards checkpoint one, scaring away most of the yet careless and unsuspecting runners.
Some daredevils risked an early death and made it through.
At the same time, lyx was patrolling the forests of Tiergarten park, helping one unfortunate runner to untangle her jacket from a bush, and catching two who completely refused to run.
Checkpoint 1: ZellengefÃ¤ngnis Lehrter StraÃ?e.
(a 19th century Prussian prison complex, famous for being as humane as to allow singular confinement and access to tiny open courtyards)
Lyx chased gaggles of runners through the futuristic main station of Berlin, only getting hold of one.
I took the shortcut to the Brandenburg gate where one runner was taken down.
Checkpoint 2: Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.
(a 19000mÂ² areal of concrete slabs)
the stelae are designed to produce an uneasy, confusing atmosphere, and the whole sculpture aims to represent a supposedly ordered system that has lost touch with human reason

I skipped the safe zone and patrolled along Unter den Linden.
I did not meet with lyx until safe zone three.
The streets were witness to several prolonged chases.
One runner was unsuspectingly following behind me, and only started running as I turned around with the monogoggles on my head and the light beam pointed at his chest.
I managed to separate another two, chasing one for several blocks.
A third group fled into the bus and did not dare to leave it in front of the safe zone.
I had fun.
Checkpoint 3: Castle place, home of the former Berlin City Castle.
At this point of the game, I was ahead of all runners.
I met with the safe zone agents, and witnessed the first two runners trickling in.
I also met with lyx and discussed our further strategy.
She would be guarding the choke points towards zone four, while I was roaming more freely.
I first guarded a radial road towards the safe zone, with a very close contact: The runner got away with a scream and a sprint as I was almost touching his shirt.
These are probably the best parts of the game, playing with the prey and exhausting them for the others.
I then moved on to a tram station on the remote corner of the safe zone.
Two times, runners emerged from the wagons, unaware of me studying the contents of the rolling fish tank.
I convinced the first two friends to play a game of stone, scissors, paper to decide which one would be dead.
Apparently there had been a one-catch-only rule announced at the start.
The remaining hand full of runners was first too scared to exit the wagon, but then decided to run for it.
proof:10, size:50, align:center
By the time the second train arrived, ten minutes later, there were five chasers patrolling the crossing towards safe zone four.
I merely had to scare the runners in the right direction, where they met their certain demise.
Checkpoint 4: Fleischerei cafÃ©
I skipped checkpoint five, instead heading directly towards safe zone six with a beer and my newly found chaser friend that lost at the stone and scissors.
Lyx, now illuminated, patrolled around safe zone five.
proof:13, size:50, align:center
Checkpoint 5: Wasserturm Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin's oldest water tower.
Reaching safe zone six, I met with the TV crew for a short interview, and so many chasers that I decided to take it easy.
At this point in time, one runner had made it through safe zone six, five passed safe zone five, and about thirty had passed safe zone four.
I caught another one out of three that tried to disembark from a tram one stop after the safe zone, where they had already spotted the chasers guarding the station.
Checkpoint 6: Mauerpark Berlin, a stretch of green, formerly the Death Strip of the Berlin wall, now home to multicultural flea markets and gleeful Workers' Day riots.
I then agreed with lyx to meet in the dark back alleys behind safe zone six and head towards the final destination.
Since I actually meant to scare more than catch, I turned on my headlight more permanently.
Still, strangely enough, while the other chasers commented on my way to good visibility, runners kept walking towards me, only to become aware of me in the very last moment.
I chased one of them into a backyard, where he later told me he would have climbed the fences had I decided to follow through.
Eventually, I met again with lyx, and headed towards the dark forest surrounding 
Checkpoint X: the Humboldthain Bunker, one of four former flak bunkers guarding the airspace above Berlin.
This one was too deeply connected with the neighbouring rail systems to be demolished with explosives.
A bagpiper served as sonic beacon for the final safe zone.

More impressions from the Journey in the pictures, and below.
The Wombat Bloodhound Kookaburras convened with the rest of the intrepid journeyers a bit after 7.
I kept having flashbacks of the last time I was in that patch of grass, when we screened  â??A Trip Down Market Streetâ? last September.
Since we had already gotten tickets for the Nurse with Wound show at the Great American Music Hall, we knew that we probably wouldnâ??t be able to make it to all five checkpoints, especially with MUNI running on a weekend schedule.
So we decided to go as far as we could in the short time that we had.
For the first leg, we set out across the upper level of Embarcadero Center.
Ronald kept lookout up ahead for chasers, and we made a point to walk and not run (why look like a target?
We sneakily exited EC at the very end and proceeded up Clay Street.
It was a steep hill, but we didnâ??t run into any trouble.
One last push up Mason and we were safe at the Fairmont.
But it was already after eight oâ??clock.
We definitely werenâ??t going to make it to all five stops.
After we got our signatures and had a critical rest stop, we headed out again.
Before leaving Mason street, we saw the silly chasers in the tiny yellow go-cart.
One was playing a recorder.
We agreed that this was a good sign.
Avoiding the cart, we continued up California towards the 27 lineâ?¦ the original plan was to take the 27 to Powell Street station, and then take Muni up Market.
But the bus wasnâ??t coming, and we were thirsty, so we detoured to Cala to get some beer.
Then it was on to Van Ness to hopefully catch a 47 or 49.
Once on Van Ness, we saw a gaggle of other players waiting at the bus stop.
So rather than standing around, we cut up to Franklin.
Ronald liberated a balloon from a car dealership along the way, so now we had a mascot.
The peaceful evening air must have made us a bit too comfortable, for several blocks later we encountered a chaser on a bike.
Ronald yelled out â??hey, heY,  hEY, HEY!
â? and he, Sierra, Jen, and Marcus all took off running.
I figured I was done for, stood my ground and said â??Hiâ? to the chaser.
He gave me the nod and rode right past me, after Ronald.
Good strategy, I guess.
I ducked into a bus stop, nervously peeking around the corner to see the rest of my team scattering across the street.
I could see Ronaldâ??s balloon bobbing in the fading light.
Sierra and Marcus disappeared.
Jen got caught.
Ronald met up with me and we hoofed it back to Van Ness.
Soon Sierra called, and the four of us met up again at the bus stop.
What about Jen?
We decided to go on without her.
It was almost nine, and weâ??d soon be heading back to go to the show.
We could meet her later.
Besides, sheâ??d been caught: she was dead to us now.
After some sneaky bus-stop avoidance maneuvers and a trek through the Octavia median strip, we made it to Itâ??s Tops and got our second signature.
But then it was time to head on to our next eveningâ??s appointment, so we called Sweetie Jim and waited for him to pick us up and schlep us to the show.
We found Jen there, and gave her the last beer as a consolation prize.
The rest of the night was a fog of situationist sound collageâ?¦ but I have to admit that I kept nervously looking for purple ribbons in the crowd.

 the long story.
STARFIVE:
I traveled from minneapolis with Celina, and we met up with InkTea, MeanJeanine and eventually OliverX.
Meeting people and hanging out in Chicago was lots of fun.
Accordians, puppets, songs, dances, tasty vegan food, feeling famous, sharing shoes and mischief.
But this.
this is all about my journey.
We arrived at the park, just in time.
We would have been there sooner, but some people had to cause some mischief (stealing the cg0 flag) earlier that we had to uh.
but it all worked out okay.
We signed up as team SPOON and CHERRY.
We procured our ribbons.
and I put the checkpoints into my iphone maps.
Inky made a friend who was going to run with us.
Then they yelled go or something and we all ran.
Someone picked a direction and our team set off.
But suddenly Inky was missing?
the new girl told us that she had told her not to follow her, that she wasn't running.
we thought.
But the clock was running.
so we had to as well.
We ran through some back streets, trying to keep off the main roads.
Down alleys.
Used the iphone to search out secret ways across the freeway.
no such luck.
Ran into some kids in an alley.
The asked about our ribbons.
We told them we were playing a game and enlisted their help in scoping out the street ahead.
Also got some instructions for a way across the freeway.
it wasn't the most secluded, but it managed to get us there without getting caught.
We saw other runners near us at times.
We had decided against the trains at this point.
figuring that might be to obvious.
We hit a couple little dead ends, but then made it into the first safe zone.
just in time to run into a chaser.
But he couldn't touch us where we were.
CUPCAKES!
and vegan too!
After being fed with sugar, we moved on.
We made it to Checkpoint two without too much trouble.
we did spot a couple suspicous figures in the distance.
We tried to lose them.
We also saw some hiding behind a distant garbage can.
But again we were safe!
Stopped for a drink of water and to consult the map.
We ask people on the street if they've seen anyone go by wearing ribbons.
some have, some haven't.
Nothing too useful.
Then came the decision.
Do we go for the first bonus checkpoint?
It's a more direct route to checkpoint 3, but there are no safe zones near it.
We risk it.
I'm glad we did.
we managed to cross the bridge and realized it was the symbol for CG0.
Oliver searched around for the bonus stamp.
He found it!
He didn't quite realize how it worked though.
he thought it was something to take with us.
so he was looking for something to cut it loose.
Luckily I was there to point out it was a stamp and ink to stamp your map.
Celina realized she'd taken photos of those stamp images at Dax's earlier.
so we knew what to look for in the other bonus checkpoints.
Unfortunately we wouldn't be making it to those checkpoints.
We got to the point where we were across the block from the 3rd checkpoint.
but we were a little unclear about where we were.
so we were consulting a map.
and suddenly Celina spots some chasers.
We scatter.
One runs after Oliver.
I run the other way.
I know I can't out run them.
I don't have the stamina.
So I duck into a parking ramp.
up the stairs and hide out.
unfortunately I don't crouch down soon enough.
I'm pretty sure one sees me from outside.
I crouch down, out of breath.
I decided that If he finds me, then i'm caught.
He comes around the corner, looking around.
He sees me on on the ground.
reaches out a finger and taps me.
I surrender my blue ribbon.
and begin a new life as a chaser.
I meet up with Oliver, who has also been caught.
we decide to keep moving.
Suddenly we see the other girls we're with.
I yell to get them!
they've been caught already too.
So now we're all chasers.
We decide to move on towards checkpoint 5.
but some runners are spotted so it takes us a little longer to get on our way.
We chase some around, but they managed to get away from all but Oliver.
We leave Mean Jeanine with Torrie(sp?
who seem to be a good team.
and take the train towards checkpoint 5.
It's nice to sit.
We explain the game to a stranger, he offers us his map of Chicago.
We decline and he wishes us luck.
We run into Dax and Beetle Bomb.
Then head over the longest bridge ever.
We stake out the area around the diner which is checkpoint 5.
We see InkTea's car!
We think up things we could do to leave her a note on her car.
Just as I'm heading to Wallgreens for some sort of supplies.
I spot some people coming down the street.
I hide on the corner behind a sign and wait.
They come around the sign and I tag one.
I chase the other into the street and tag her in the crosswalk.
I look at my map wanting to make sure they are fair tags.
The map shows me that safe zone is no the the diner corner and all across the bridge.
My sign has no safe zone.
but they want to fight it.
I agree to go inside and ask.
Inky is the Checkpoint person.
She calls that one is fair, the other isn't.
So I get one ribbon.
The girl I tagged on the sidewalk seems upset and really wants to win.
She says she was in the street.
I'm pretty certain she was on the sidewalk when i got her.
I take her friend's ribbon instead.
We chase some more people around the whole foods parking lot.
Celina gets a kill.
We wait down the street a bit.
Oliver calls me saying there's a group coming up the street on the next block.
I hide in a bank alley.
I jump out just as they get to me.
there is confusion.
They try to throw their non-playing friend at me, but I manage to tag all the other 3.
We wait around a little while longer.
I use my camera as a spy device and get an image of someone around the corner, but never found them.
Eventually we are too exhausted to go on.
we make our way to the end.
At least it didn't rain!
We barely make it to the end.
which has been moved.
Every step hurts.
But we make it.
Oliver gets a moxie medal for his story of using children as spotters.
We limp back across the park and catch a cab to the after party.
It's so worth it.
Alcohol helps numb the pain in my legs and feet.
We stay for a while.
then make our way back to beds.
Much pain the next day.
a little less each day after.
Three days later I can walk without much pain at all.
I should have stretched before.
and not eaten so much.
but at least I had good shoes!
It was lots of fun, but so tiring.
I met neat people.
Saw more of Chicago than I have before.
proof:2, size:25px, align:center
Informed we'd have sweet things to eat,
We drew up the concept you see,
We shopped and we sewed,
To make these cute clothes,
And now we're the T.
proof:1, size:25px, align:center

At seven thirty-seven they appeared
The first two players heading up the pack.
They shouted out for water as they neared,
But all we had to offer was a snack.
It wasn't long before we saw the rest:
All furtive stealth and sweaty brows aglow.
The people from Chicago did the best
Because they knew the quickest ways to go.
At Life's Too Short no one had lately dined
'hind padlocked doors with pints of MGD.
A cartoon hot dog from another time,
Delighted in its new-found company.
A certain sadness marks this dead bar's name,
But how it speaks the spirit of our game!
Cops cause some alarm.
'Openin' dat place back kup?
'
A laugh shared by all.
Don't want a cup cake?
Did I mention they're vegan?
'I want a cup cake.
I had one of the best experiences of this year at this event.
I managed to make it a half block from the 6th safe zone before getting caught at the last minute.
It was, quite honestly, one of the most terrifying moments of my life.
I tried to run, but she was on me before I went more than a few steps.
This was actually the second time I got caught.
The first time, I was walking down an alley between checkpoints 5 and 6.
I saw two heads pop out at the end of the street and ducked and hid behind some garbage cans.
I saw one chaser walk past and out of my line of sight, but I knew better than to be fooled by this point.
The chaser continued to circle closer.
He finally pulled out a flashlight and I knew that I was done for.
As I crouched in terror behind the garbage cans, I watched the beam of light creep slowly around them.
It hit my shoes and I exploded up, trying to make a break for it.
Sadly, I smacked straight into him.
He tagged me, and congratulated me on my hiding skills, saying that, \I almost got away with it.'
He groaned, \you've got to be fucking kidding me.'
It began one evening in the Embarcadero with hundreds of people dressed in costume, some as the Mona Lisa, some as The Doctor, and others and comic book characters and fisherman.
I myself was Death from Neil Gaiman's Sandman.
I was initially part of a group of six, we had drawn out a route (all on foot) and distributed the maps so that all would have them and we could meet up at some point.
Once the race began however we quickly scattered.
My sister and I sprinted together from the starting line and made it to the first checkpoint with little trouble (minus the costume pieces that broke in the chaos that was running from the chasers) and much sweaty makeup.
We quickly cooled down walking and buying some water from a gas station that hadn't been infiltrated.
We made our way to the second checkpoint with again little trouble and in around fifteen minutes, we stood in line waiting for the signitures and talked it up with the other players, we were offered a chacne to join team Zombieland, an offer my sister and I later regretted not taking up.
After this checkpoint we reunited with my father who had become a chaser and he became a member of our team, 'Decoy Dad'.
We were sadly ambushed midway to the third checkpoint by some chasers that lay in wait on 7th street.
Now that we had become chasers we decided to plan an ambush on 10th and Folsom for all those who would be at he fourth checkpoint, and this plan actually did get our team one yellow ribbon but there were casualties.
As I ran after a player into the rode I slipped and came down hard on my side, scraping and bruising my right side.
After I lay in pain on the street we sook shelter at the Lone Star Bear bar and waited for Shawn(?
) to give us a lift to Walgreens so I could bandage my wounds and go ahead to Noisebridge, which I ended up knowing because a friend of mine's girlfriend is a member.
All in all Journey to the End of the Night was AMAZING and I hope there's another event organized soon because I can name at least ten people off the top of my head who would be interested in a heart beat to do it.
Over and out.
It was a first for my husband and me.
all on foot.
in a city that, though we have lived in Minneapolis for 3 years, we still don't know quite that well.
We know it much better now.
Our friends in Chicago had been signed up for the Journey for weeks when I realized, the day of, that we also had access to such a super fun event.
We went in having no real clue what we were doing and, unfortunately, it showed.
We got tagged quite quickly due to a rookie mistake of stopping for a snack.
NEVER STOP FOR A SNACK.
At least it was a delicious burrito snack.
We learned a lot, though, and had a super fun time.
We will come better prepared next year.
Snacks will be chosen for their ability to be eaten on the run.
I suppose we could go without snacks.
That seems crazy.
Went based on a recommendation from a friend from my LARP group, Westfinder.
We met up at the amphitheater, adopting the name \Team Asylum Plan\': Me
At this point, David S and I knew the area the best.
The blizzard snow did runway bury deep.
We fly on time, I'm told, by stewardess.
A stranded bride, her wedding date to keep,
Has pleaded with the airline, in distress.
A voucher large they offer to us all
To take a fourteen hour long delay.
And thus to Journey I can travel free.
Except my airline flies not to St.
So first in C.
Zero I shall stay.
Then go, by bus, a city new, to see.
Beside the river, it is not yet dark.
Wring water from our rain-soaked clothes and bags.
We stretch and chat, and stroll about the park.
Oh, were you there, last night, in zombie drag?
From soapbox high a quiet voice commands.
We gather round, the rules are spelled out clear.
Manifests and ribbons passed around.
The runners tense and gather into bands.
Our faces smile, our eyes show hints of fear.
And then in howling instant, Journey-bound!
Toward island bonus or to checkpoint one,
I figure that the pack would likely head.
North East I turn, and quickly I do run
To take the checkpoint from the rear instead.
Cross parking lots and lawns and up to Fifth.
Hard running, ducking, sneaking, filled with fear.
Join group of frat boys, try to act the part,
and save my strength by trading speed for stealth.
They turn when highway bridge was drawing near,
Toward choke point I now race with speeding heart.
Beside the bridge, I spot a fearsome bird.
Could falconry be Unit's Easter Egg?
But there's no time to ponder the absurd.
I race across, begin another leg.
To Seventeenth, cross campus, double back.
See someone up ahead, and hug the walls.
In hidden stairwell, check the compass, map.
Then speed toward checkpoint, but there's no attack.
Signed forms, brief rest, and then my Journey calls.
I cannot stop, lest chasers build a trap.
A bonus checkpoint beckons, very near.
I take the risk, get lost in campus maze.
Through bushes, slinking.
Wait, I was just here!
And there's the plaque!
Rush toward it in a craze.
Then off again, three blocks, to alley, stop.
Pull map and study bridges.
Which to pick?
Bridge Cappelin, far south, is a safe bet.
But time's been lost.
Toward Washington I drop.
At ends of bridge, I'm sure, are chasers thick.
But I am fast, I may outrun them yet.
From lower deck, to indoor building stair.
Cross plaza, rush, and onto neutral ground.
Ribbons pass, this is a deadly snare.
Try handles 'til an unlocked door is found.
In crouching run, below the window glass.
I make my way along the unsafe trail,
To end of bridge, and climb the barricade.
Leap down, land running south.
I'm hauling ass.
Two chasers, far behind, but on my tail.
In parking structure my escape is made.
I circle wide, approach Two from the rear,
To catch the checkpoint squatters unaware.
As I approach, three runners pass, in fear.
Two chasers on their tail, I flee from there.
Through hedge and into yard.
What's this?
Two children and a pool-toy stare in shock.
At sight of panicked stranger rushing past.
I cannot hide.
To checkpoint two I go.
Three times am turned away and circle blocks, 
On forth attempt, at last, complete the task.
A swarm of chasers hovers, buzzing 'round.
Next checkpoint and all bonuses are West.
I spot incoming runners, checkpoint bound.
As chasers watch them, I break from the nest.
Run east some blocks, then south, I quickly steer.
I stop and find I've wondered off the map.
On Franklin Avenue I travel west,
Toward bonus checkpoint, once more from the rear.
Then up Chicago, wary of a trap.
Search corner, garden, doorway, in distress.
A noise from down the street catches my ear.
Some gathered men who stand around and talk.
They're calm and don't react as I draw near.
Safe runners!
Oh there can be no doubt.
So toward the group I go, run slow, at ease.
I watch for chasers hiding to my side.
And then when we are only feet apart,
Catch sight of red, and then confused, I freeze.
The fiends awake, and I've no chance to hide.
Am tagged!
Have lost!
Oh, heavy heart.
My resurrection ribbon none do want.
Absurd, I say, for crazy they must be.
Then Dok agrees, and I begin to hunt.
And off I head in search of checkpoint three.
Midway I change my mind and opt instead
To start at checkpoint six, reverse the route.
A joyful Death I meet, and chat a while.
He tells me south on Nico' I should head.
From checkpoint four first runner started out.
I hatch a plan at bridge, in sniper style.
Tween Nicollet and First street I do hide.
In bush in empty lot and bide my time,
With view of city block on either side.
Shea Wolf approaches slowly, I have time,
To creep with stealth to edge of bridge and then
Wait 'till his final rear-ward look, and run!
As quietly as I can I slip behind
And catch up to him 'fore he knows I'm there.
He has a resurrection ribbon.
Grab manifest then off and running blind.
Up Nicollet, cross bridge, and then I duck
Into a parking lot.
Two fences hop,
At alley end turn corner, and what luck
Behind a resturaunt dumpster I can drop.
There's time to rest, drink water, study map.
Five blocks from checkpoint six and in the lead!
I plan a risky straight course up LaSalle.
Since Nicollet is sure to be a trap.
Stupidity is stronger than my greed,
Get lost, and onto Nicollet I fall.
Jump fence, then out from alley into street.
With naught to lose, I run without restraint.
In seconds I hear chaser's pounding feet.
Collide with taxi, flee from loud complaint.
Ahead the pillars beckon, checkpoint six!
From 'cross the street half dozen chasers swarm
Surround me from all sides, and I am penned.
We bob and weave along the corporate bricks
Then I am caught, blue ribbon finds new arm.
In thirty seconds, he's at Journey's end.
As chaser, once again, toward bridge I head.
Meet Oliver and join in planned stakeout.
Catch Dax!
But wait, he is already dead.
Was running after Tac, whom I've helped out.
In hiding space beyond bridge rail I duck.
To ambush runners coming down the trail.
Am noticed, stranger's eyes are full of fear.
Ten minutes later, siren, lights, oh fuck!
Police car stops, and I vault over rail.
Three blocks, across a bridge, and I am clear.
I pause, look back, the cop stopped not for me.
A car, pulled over, happened to be there.
I lurk in stairwells, crouch high in a tree.
Decide I will not tag, but aim to scare.
A ribbon passes, wrong way down the path.
A runner, I make chase.
I match her speed, will stop when turn she makes.
That was the plan, but fate other plans hath.
It's Dela, spent from yellow-ribbon race.
She stops, and I've no choice but ribbon take.
As runner numbers have begun to shrink,
Toward checkpoint closing time the hour grows,
I head for checkpoint five, coffee to drink,
Find Dax, who runs anew, and C.
As bus pulls up, in bear hug I am trapped.
From safe to safe they rush before I'm free.
I run ahead, catch bus when next is stopped.
On bus, beside large runner I am cramped.
The driver sides with runners, against me.
Thus in the checkpoint safe zone they are dropped!
And here, dear reader, ends my journey tale.
A few quick comments further I will add.
As poetry, this text is full of fail.
As praxis, though, it is, perhaps, half bad.
Why mess about with complicated rhyme?
It is a gimmick, boredom for to fight.
See, Journey proofs are mired in sticky tar.
A straight writeup I'd not complete on time.
The brain which Journeys never learned to write.
And brain which writes watched Journey from afar.
I've run before from men who want to hurt.
From cops and muggers, running is no fun.
In Journey, though, with danger we just flirt.
I've na'er before so much enjoyed a run.
To run alone, in city strange, was grand.
On edge of being lost at every turn.
It's something primal, deep, without a name.
When words, I use, they always sound so bland.
I tell you that I've seen a fire burn.
It can't compare to gazing at the flame.
A chaser's job is nasty, dark, and cruel.
Now hear me out, I know we need the red.
A runner without chasers is a fool,
A Journey with no chasers would be dead.
The chaser's Journey, though, is mighty sad.
To steal away another runner's fun?
Each tag is not a victory, but loss.
As chaser, I just wound up feeling bad.
So thank you, reds, who gave me cause to run, 
And took upon yourselves the chaser cross.
To Oliver and Star who lent us beds,
And Dax and Fox who, for me, did the same.
And all of M.
Zero, live and dead,
Who showed us a good time the night we came,
InkTea, who battled traffic, caught my bus,
And Indy's friend whose name I can't recall,
To our brunch hosts and after-party crew,
And all who spent time visiting with us,
The Journey staff and planners, one and all,
I offer heart-felt thanks to each of you.
When I first read about the whole thing on Couch Surfing around 4pm Saturday I wasn't sure if I should come (thanks to Brandon who did an amazing job to post it there and actually got me and a other person into it).
Then I decided it would be better just to go there instead of hanging out at home.
So I got ready in like 40 min, jumped on the train (which I almost missed) and ran down to the meeting point.
It was amazing!
There were so many people standing there!
I thought, that there might be 50-70 but when I came around the corner the place was filled!
They gave us the blue and pink ribbons and I still believed that I would never have to give up the blue!
The run started and over 200 people just ran in one direction.
I saw other people starring at us with faces like \crazy people in chicago running all in the same direction\'.'
I was so out of shape that my lungs burned after a few feet and I had to slow down even if the adrenaline was pushing through my venes.
I always turned around and looked for chasers everywhere.
Then I saw one coming down the way on his bike and we just started to run again.
My muscles started to burn and I really wished that I would have went to the gym more often in the last couple months.
But we got safe to Checkpoint one and could stamp our paper!
That was a great feeling.
I was still with Brandon and he did a good job while guiding me to the next checkpoint.
We went into a parking lot, met other runners in an elevator and ran through Target, always looking for Chasers.
The teacher on the second point were awesome!
We went down the bridge after we got our stickers.
And then I saw it, THE CHICKEN ON THE BIKE.
I remembered that Dax said something about it and so I told Brandon.
We started running and ran into the Walgreens parkinglot (where they have a drive through).
I was weigh behind Brandon and so I tried to escaped behind the car.
But the chicken got me at the end and so I became a Chaser.
Now I had a serious problem, didn't I come here to see the city of Chicago and meet new people?
I was there without my blue ribbon and didn't even know where I was.
The German girl lost in Chicago.
But at least I'm not that bad in reading maps and so I got the direction where to go.
When I was standing on the light and was studying my card someone tipped me on my shoulder and said \it's green
So I cought my first one.
He and me hunted together and so I got 2, 3 and 4.
He left me at Checkpoint 3 and I called Brandon who got caught, too.
So I was waiting for him and still tried to catch other runner.
After we were reunited we called the number on the phone to find out what the hidden point was.
We found it and they signed Checkpoint 4 for us.
(We could choose between 3, 4 or 5.
)
But we stilll walked to Chinatown to see Checkpoint 4.
We ate there (amazing food!
) and after one hour we started to Checkpoint 5 (Tara came with us).
We met an other guy who had mustard all over and he told us that a girl tried to defend her helf while spitting it at him (but he cought her anyways, hehe!
We found Checkpoint 5 under a bridge and there were four other player who were still blue!
After they ran away (we were too tired and too full to hunt them -) ) we walked to the finish line where we found a bunch of people.
It was amazing to hear that over 50 people were still \alive\'!'
I was very proud of myself that I walked everywhere and didn't even use the CTA once!
:-D
At the end congratulation to all of the players who were still blue at the end and to the other one, who finished the game and didn't give up, too!
Thanks to all the guys who made this possible and I really hope I'll find some people to make this work in Munich!
(If someone knows if there is something like that already in Munich or just wants to give me some tips and advise, please send me a message I would be happy to hear from you guys!
Due to the epic nature of my evening, this will be a long
write up, so grab your spectacles and sit a spell.
I will try to break it
into bite sized chunks for easier consumption.
You are now about to
witness the saga of a Journey Into the End of the Night, through the eyes of
Gremlin.
Â 
FIRST MISTAKE â?? Shoes
2nd mistake â?? Didnâ??t leave extra layer at house

Journey to the End of the Night
youtube:http://www.
v=cjySETfm0T8
The Order assembled and when the bell rang for the hunt to begin, we were immediately broken in half.
Meeting up at checkpoint 1A Ebay says, â??Fuck you guys, we are going North.
You make decisions too slow.
We are using strategy.
â?
At checkpoint three I turn to our Ghost and ask, â??Have we heard from Ebay?
â?
â??She says she will meet us at four.
She just finished checkpoint two.
â? Then he says, â??I donâ??t see why we donâ??t just wait for her?
â?
I squint.
â??Because I donâ??t trust her.
Because sheâ??s been caught.
â?
â??Well, there is that,â? the Ghost tells me.
Senator Markov appears from the shadows and asks, â??Why arenâ??t we moving out?
â?
I tell him in cold hushed tones, â??We are going to wait for Samantha.
â?
 â??That doesnâ??t seem unreasonable.
â?
We mill about at the young womanâ??s birthday party, we take pictures in the deep green light.
I eat her popcorn and some of the Senatorâ??s peanuts.
Sam doesnâ??t show up and I gather us up to move out.
Right before we cross Sheridan a bus comes and a young girl in a pure blue ribbon gets on.
On the bus sit five red ribbons, sharp, white teeth a blast and sharpening.
GET OFF THAT BUSS, BLUE!
â?
She tells me, â??What?
Itâ??s a safe zone, stupid.
â?
â??GET OFF THAT GOD FORSAKEN BUS.
ITâ??S FILLED WITH RED!
â?
â??Itâ??s safe.
â?
â??They canâ??t eat you on the bus, but you canâ??t get off the bus, youâ??ll be trapped on it forever.
â?
She looks at them as if to ask, is this true?
They shrug, and the driver shuts the door.
Sheâ??s never heard from again.
As we cross the street I call Ebay.
â??Where are you?
â? 
â??We just made it to three, we are headed to you at four.
â?
â??You fucking red, mother fucker.
â?
â??What?
â?
â??We waited for you.
You arenâ??t at three, and you never were.
â?
â??You waited for us?
â?
Click.
On the other side of the street we meet up with Dela Dejavoo.
She tells of us of her grand deeds.
youtube:http://www.
v=6PQ6335puOcandfeature=youtu.
beandt=26s

Satisfied we travel with her.
Shooting down a back alley I start to scope out a back yard.
â??What the fuck you doing?
â? A man on a porch asks.
â??We seek safe passage out of this alleyway,â? I tell him.
â??It ainâ??t me,â? he tells us plainly and we move on.
A half block further south we hear him gnawing on dying chaser.
â??What you mother fuckers doing in my yard!
I all told you fuckers to stay out.
Come back here!
Iâ??ll fuck you up!
You in a game, mother fucker, Iâ??ll fucking tag your lilly ass, asshole!
â?
We speed up the pace, find a hidden garden that gets us out of the alley and back onto the main streets.
Now Ebay calls the Senator.
With a smirk he hands the phone to me, but before I can say hello her red venom starts to spew, â??Listen to me, I think Senator Danâ??s red.
If he calls you and tells you anything, donâ??t trust him.
Heâ??s not on your side anymore!
â?
â??Thisâ??isâ??Dan.
â?
â??Oh SHIT!
No, if this is you, send me a picture of your blue ribbon!
â?
â??Hahahahaha!
â? I am laughing at her dulled red brained foolishness, it is not my blueness thatâ??s in question but hers.
There is no time for further bullshit, a chaser leaps out in front of us.
A Female redblood, she throws out her arms, bring it style, and says, â??All four corners,â? she drools, indicating that weâ??ve been trapped.
We sprint away.
In beeline formations we buzz in and out of the street.
Thinking us stuck the redbeards pursue us slowly.
They do not know about the secret garden.
We go back through the gate and under the arch and vanish.
Feeling stuck, we decide to head back to checkpoint three and get our bearings.
But there is a lost chaser in the alleyway and one of us is tagged.
Luckily we are close enough to the checkpoint at this point to argue the tagging and win, the venom wears off.
From three to four I am split from my compatriots.
I finish by 11:48 with the Senator and right before one of the men who guided me with his mystical maps from last year.
The chasers this time were a vile concoction, the chasers, as shown accurately here, were subhuman.
But it seems a change to our Every Day Life World is being undergone.
Upon completion of this task I run into Rubin!
When I wake up the next day, Chicagoâ??s landscape has changed.
I seek the Orderâ??s compound and no one is there.
I seek the Senatorâ??s office, and I canâ??t find him.
Almost 200 of us survived the May 7th Journey, but it seemed the red virus hadnâ??t stopped spreading as it had in previous iterations of Journey.
Overnight it had manipulated and morphed.
Evolved, if you could call it that?
I don't know how I slept through it but when I awoke all these buildings, once beautiful and strong, were turned into burnt out husks.
And the Reds.
the Reds were everywhere.
Devouring, assimilating!
Those humans left, in posting this, I beg you, I plead with you, stay in contact, we must regroup and run again!
I have a plan.
We will escape the red.
For we have found ourselves no longer in an era of Everyday Life, it seems weâ??ve found ourselves in the era of JEN.
I will try to update this when I have more information on the,
DissorderoftheWildOnion,
-dan
PS: Also for those able to reach san fran, think about running here.
we took the Halsted bus from inside UIC to get to the point 3.
on almost every stop from Roosevelt south more and more chasers were coming in.
at certain point there were more players and chasers on the bus than regular customers.
some players tried to jump out just before the bus took off from a stop and some of the chasers jumped after them.
every player on the bus was speculating how to get safely out.
we missed the 19th street and continued south with chasers just waiting for us to get out of the doors.
the orange line saved us.
we jumped from the bus into the station.
after couple of minutes the air was clean and we started our way back to point 3.
it was great to find some new places in the city.
We were willing to walk the extra blocks off the beaten path.
Whole Foods, Target and LA Fitness became our sanctuaries of anonymity.
What we lacked in physical stamina, we make up for in patience and calculation.
The Journey was ours to conquer.
We nary saw a Chaser before checkpoint One and Two.
Twas Checkpoint Three where the problems began.
Within our Safe Zone Shroud, we were surrounded by Pinks.
We tried to wait them out, but they were keen to our map-studying facade.
But our patience prevailed, as they went after another group of less savvy Blues.
With the coast looking clear, we decided to make the necessary movings on.
It was around this moment that the videographer asked if she could film us.
We should have taken it as a sign.
She knew what, or who, lay beyond the hedge.
They executed their attack with precise timing.
My group of brave women now screamed, panicked, ran into each other.
There were at least three on my tail, shouting \GET HER!'
But not without a fight.
As I rounded a corner into an alley, I looked for anything to help me outsmart my foes.
And there they were.
A row of trash cans.
The Chasers were within 5 feet of me when I rounded past the cans.
With one reach of faith I grabbed the corner of the trash can, knocking it over in my wake.
I heard crashing and screams of surprise.
I darted around the next corner.
Into a dead end alley.
The game was up.
Next year I'll be able to hop 15 ft fences.
This year was just a practice run.
Dedicated to Abu, my greatest of foes, my fall.
It's like this short story, \An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.'
This time my Owl Creek Bridge was between the first and the second checkpoint.
I had safely made it to the bus stop at Folsom and 7th.
Standing there was a bit like taking shelter from heavy rain.
Just with chasers instead of rain.
You stick your head out, you realize how heavy the rain still is, and you are awed into waiting for a few more minutes.
Raindrops, however, normally don't yell \Friggin' safe zones!'
And then you make the calamitous mistake that you always make in heavy rain and that England sometimes makes in soccer: You start bravely - but not very strategically - dashing forward, hoping for the best.
For a couple of seconds things actually went according to plan.
I was running towards 6th and, halfway there, I was impossible to miss by an oncoming group of chasers.
They started running, too, and I turned around in an attempt to make it back to the bus stop - which by then seemed too risky to reach.
Another group of chasers was hanging out at the French deli truck next to the stop.
Where had they come from?
Desperate, I ran into a small side street and the unthinkable happened: the chasers lost interest.
Unfortunately, they lost interest, because I was running into the arms of other chasers.
I managed to stay ahead of them for a couple of yards.
But my pounding head had started to feel as if an energetic couple was dancing polka in it whilst wearing ski boots.
My lungs felt as if I had inhaled a little person with a sandblaster who was now merrily sandblasting away inside.
My legs felt like the wooden utility posts in North Beach - nails and staples everywhere.
I had my Owl Creek moment.
England vs.
Chasers - 0:1.
We sat down on the pavement, exhausted, and what followed would have made for a pretty good public service announcement for sportsmanship, only that it was real and genuine.
We talked for a while about the anxious anticipation that we had felt back at the Ferry Building, the routes that we had taken to the first checkpoint, how the journey changed your perspective of places that you had seen a dozen times before, how the journey made you find and explore places that you had never seen before, how it made you spot details around you that would otherwise go unnoticed, and how the journey was a little bit like making love: physical, but the best part happened in your head.
Call me naive, but somehow the knowledge that there are people around who organize experiences like the journey helps me keep my belief in mankind.
Well, this praxis is going to lack pictures, for, alas, I had no time nor energy, nor camera that takes good pictures at night.
I'll think of some pictures that I can put in here, just to make it pretty.
maybe diagrams.
Diagrams are good.
Thanks for a great game!
This was a really fun night.
So here's the thing: I am colorblind.
Not so much that I don't see colors, but certain colors get mixed up and impossible to distinguish if there is little light, the distance is large and the color nuances are in certain categories, such as - you guessed it - thin green and orange plastic bands tied around the arms of people far away on a pavement in the middle of the night.
So this was going to be an interesting night.
I came to the game with my girlfriend Elena, she is really tough but I'm not, so this was going to be a night of stealth and sneaking around rather than playing of cat and mouse with scary chasers.
(Also, I'd been burnt before - in JTTEOTN: Oakland I got caught in a sad, sad way, when I was sneaking up to checkpoint four, seeing some nice guys I'd been running along with earlier in the evening, so I waved at them.
and suddenly realised that they had turned to the dark side.
(Did I mention the thing about being colorblind?
) I ran until my lungs hurt, and thought I had lost them - that is, I had lost the three guys, but this girl kept jogging after me.
So I sprinted some more, turned and by golly, she was still there.
So I continued, by now coming full circle around the block, limbs aching, my lungs collapsing, and I had to stop.
Which she didn't.
Very sad story.
) 
Seeing the crowd at the start we where overwhelmed with fear, but somehow managed to grab some of the very last waiver forms and get in the game.
proof:1size:100align:left
proof:2size:100align:left
As the start signal went off, we decided to take it easy and walk to checkpoint one, following something of a detour along the waterfront.
This worked excellently, but on leaving checkpoint 1 we saw a lot of chasers and realized we had to stay alert.
So we hustled up Brannan and approached cp 2 by passing under the freeway on 5th street.
There was a chaser, but we heroically confused him by splitting up and running each our way, rendez-vousing inside the safezone.
Well a little sweat actually, but hey, we're not 18 anymore.
proof:2size:100align:left
So we decided to take the bus to cp 3.
Dead easy!
Except there were chasers on the bus, who followed everyone of the bus and caught them from behind.
Surely that must be a violation of the Geneva convention.
Anyway we got away cause we were chickens and stayed on the bus for a couple of stops further.
And this prisoner's dilemma thing on cp3?
No bell-wielding secret agents could threaten the strength of our scandi-latino passion.
One small bell each.
Except we nearly got ourselves killed when we exited the safezone, nearly ran into the arms of a couple of chasers and opted to jump on the hood of a passing taxi instead.
Better dead than red!
(or orange - did I mention the colorblind problem?
)
We got away and found a bus stop, got to cp 4 with no effort and decided that this bus thing was a great idea.
Except that by now there were 30 chasers between us and the bus stop.
\Luckily\' the bus took half an hour to arrive
From there and in it was all a-cruisin.
Well if sneaking around and throwing nervous glances over your shoulder counts as a-cruisin.
The dash when the whistle went off proved to be the first challenge: after three blocks, I realized I had dropped my cell phone and we retraced our steps to (thankfully) find it lying on the ground, unstolen.
After that we began to walk toward Sansome street to get to Coit Tower, but were met with the sight of Ian on a bicycle sporting a red band.
We ran back around the block and because it was early in the game, he had mercy and we werenâ??t followed.
We got all the way to the stairs below Coit Tower, and then spotted blue-band sf0-ers hiding in some trees.
Following our instincts, we hid alongside them and decided to join groups.
We looped back around the block but there was a chaser across the street.
He started running toward us and we split into two groups, running off into different directions.
I lost the chaser (and the group) but met player Avidd on the stairs up to the top of Coit tower.
Those were difficult stairs, but the view of the bay was brilliant, made even better by the sunset.
At the top I met back up with my group, and we set off for Jackson street.
There was some confusion over which direction to go, but we made it there without chasers, except right after getting the signature we headed down an ally and had to split off again when a player sprinted past.
We lost the chasers but half the group was gone, and were a bit vague on the phone when asked whether theyâ??d been tagged.
Ramon and I decided to head out to the third checkpoint anyway, and started walking with another group.
We started up the steep slopes of Nob Hill and noticed the shadows of two players in front of us.
They appeared to be harmless.
However, one of them was red, and had just tricked her friend into believing she was blue.
Tagging, running, madness ensued everyone split.
I turned just in time to see Ramon get tagged, still a bit confused.
The rest of us split and scattered.
I walked with Tom a bit, only to get chased again by someone different with a dog.
I stopped at a bus stop, completely out of breath.
Thankfully, I survived and began, once again, walking up a hill.
I saw Tom, and he called Ashley, and we walked to the third checkpoint.
I saw Ramon, who had decided to become neutral.
He graciously offered to walk in front of us and warn us if anyone red started coming.
We caught the #1 bus and walked down to Japantown without any trouble, meeting back up with Neil, one of the group who had got caught by the pretending chaser.
He had a mission of vengeance, which Ramon agreed to assist him in.
Unfortunately, the targeted person had already been turned into a chaser, and Ramon and Niel just became regular chasers.
At this point I had to drop out of the game and go home.
Jason:
Pregame
I picked up Nicole around 5:30 so we could get dinner together and try to find a parking space downtown.
Succeeding in both, we were early to registration and caught up with Ian, Sean and Sam.
More people arrived, some I knew, some I didn't know.
I was in a kind of shy mood so I didn't go up and introduce myself to many people, unfortunately.
Still, these new-to-me people might become future enemies during the night, so perhaps best to play it safe.
Meanwhile, a friend and coworker of mine that was intending to come called to say that he had lost his house keys on the Golden Gate Bus, so he had to figure out how he'd be spending the weekendand#8212in his place or not.
I still don't know what happened to him.
Like Vladypus said, when we saw that teams were possible, he, Kelly, Nicole and I started to team up, as at that point we were expecting one more (that would be Eris).
But then Vlad and Kelly decided to go it on their own, which ended up working out.
Eris had brought her friend Sean, and then our friend Aynne called me to see if she was too late to get into the race.
Aynne made it but had brought another friend, David, but he ended up in another team with people he knew.
With our team finalized I dubbed it The End User Case because it was the only thing I could think of.
But everyone seemed to like it, so it was done.
As all this organizing was going on, we all got outfitted with blue and purple ribbons to designate racer/chaser status, a map of the race course, and free 1\ buttons for the taking.'
Nicole
5-4-3-2-1-go.
I didn't see which direction everyone went I just know at least half of us ran northwest and through some shopping/hotel complex to get to California Street.
We saw many people running on uphill on foot, but we opted to catch the bus right off the bat, with the intention of pacing ourselves.
After 10 minutes waiting for the bus, however, we needed to think of alternatives.
Eris has this brilliant idea of calling the hotel, claiming to have a reservation under the name Jones at the hotel's restaurant, and telling them that the bus was nowhere to be found.
could they send a shuttle?
No dice, they didn't go for it.
Shortly thereafter, a bus appeared around the corner and we were heading up California.
A few other players got on along the way, including Aaro, whose group had been split up by chasers.
The folks in purple apparently meant to get it started early.
Hearing that we were trying to get into the hotel, an uninvolved passenger on the bus told us about a side entrance.
We thanked him but it didn't register, since we all went for the front door, anyway.
The bus almost made it to Mason Street, but right before, it got stuck uphill behind a double-parked car.
By that time many of us were standing by the exit door in back, in anticipation of the scramble to the demilitarized, chaser-neutral zone, and when the bus driver asked us if we wanted off there, we all responded with an emphatic, \Yes!'
Checkpoint 1 and#8213 950 Mason Street and#8213 The Fairmont Hotel
We saw players coming out of the hotel.
well, honestly it seemed like every player besides those of us who just got off the bus was coming out of the hotel, and I don't know how they got uphill so fast on foot.
We went inside, found our contacts (which turned out to be Ian's parents), got info on the next contact (a woman in a brown trenchcoat), got our signatures and were back out the front door.
Except there were at least two chasers on bicycles, circling like sharks to catch anyone who went the obvious direction.
Eris (I think) again to the rescue: back into the hotel, we searched for the back entrance on Powell Street.
We had to go down a floor but we found it.
Eris and Sean poked their heads out, saw the coast was clear, and we ran two blocks downhill towards Market Street before I asked them to slow down.
A lot of running downhill meant my gut bouncing, meaning my recent appendectomy scar getting agitated, and I wanted to avoid potential problems.
They kindly acquiesced, but with red lights it turned out to be the same in terms of timing.
Keeping an eye out for purple bicyclists, we made our way down to Market Street and the plaza at the cable car turntable.
Not knowing who was around, we ran from the cover of buildings across the plaza and down the stairs to the MUNI subway station.
A panhandler addressed us on the way down, saying, \Slow down!'
On the L (K?
), we discussed our options: get out at Van Ness and take the direct route, or try going to the Church Street stop and doubling back, with less chasers stationed on the back door?
Aynne pointed out that the Van Ness stop meant any running to safety would be done uphill, so we went with the Church Street option.
Going down Market in the open, we thought maybe we had made it there quickly enough that the chasers wouldn't have had time to station themselves there, but no.
Just before we got to the intersection with Laguna/Guerrero, a man talking on a cell phone andand#8212we noticed too lateand#8212a purple ribbon sticking out of his hat got not ten feet in front of us before he shut his phone and said, \Hi!'
Right after his greeting, Aynne broke left towards the street, and the chaser went right for her.
I, on the right side of the group, shot to the right and forward across the street, into the safe zone.
Turning around, I saw only Nicole heading my direction.
I called out to her, asking how many of us made it.
When she held up two fingers, I was a bit crestfallen.
Had our whole team been decimated just like that?
A moment later, we spotted Sean across the street in the safe zone, and he rejoined us.
We didn't see Eris and Aynne for the rest of the night, though we later got an SMS that they were on the beach.
Checkpoint 2 and#8213 1801 Market Street and#8213 It's Tops
We found Sarah enjoying dinner at the It's Tops diner.
Getting her signature on our manifests, we asked her how many people had shown up before us.
She let us know we were #s 5, 6, and 7and#8212only 4 players in front!
After she told us to look for a woman with a broken wrist at the next checkpoint, we thanked her and headed back outside.
Our original plan involved catching the N-Judah out through and under Twin Peaks and then catching a bus north, but we saw the chasers starting to swarm in the direction we'd need to go.
We figured that ours wasn't the only team to have suffered losses at this point, and the number of chasers was increasing, making things a lot more difficult.
After some deliberation and speculation, we decided to head north on Octavia and start cutting across and around, with the intention of making it to the station before anyone noticed us amidst the other pedestrians.
Instead, as we cut across a street, Sean spotted the bus stop on Haight Street and we waited there in safety.
Only a few minutes passed before we caught the bus up into the Upper Haight.
Along the way, another racer (Liam?
) got on the bus and joined us in the back.
He told us that a friend of his, a chaser, was also on the bus, waiting to follow him out once he got out.
This turned out to be Devin, and you can read his side of this leg of the race in his documentation.
The four of us tried to look inconspicuous and considered our options.
We told Liam that our plan was to get out at Masonic and take the bus north from there to Geary.
Liam was going to go with us, but then he said he was going to get off early to pull Devin off the bus, confident he could outrun and get around him.
He did so somewhere in the Haight, calling out to Devin and getting out the back.
Devin, reading his book, didn't get out in time and ended up getting out at the next stop, never noticing we were there.
At Masonic, we waited again, and discussed that the waiting was slowing us down and would continue to do so.
I pointed out that there wasn't going to be a magic bus anywhere along the route that could get us there without having to transfer, and since we also lost two of our team, there was no bonus points to be had at this point, and that staying alive was more important.
It's just the nature of the game.
The bus came, we took it to Geary, and took the Geary bus right into the safe zone across the street from the third checkpoint.
On the Geary bus we ran into Lars, Jenny and some others I didn't recognize.
When we got out, everyone seemed to be heading down the street.
in the wrong direction, I saw, when I checked the street signs.
(When looking for 2807, 2900and#8594 means reverse!
) We stopped Sean from going that way, and everyone else was already across the street and out of the safe zone, but.
this was a race.
We took off wordlessly up Geary in the other direction, and jaywalked across the street.
Checkpoint 3 and#8213 2807 Geary Boulevard and#8213 Family Billiards
2807 Geary turned out to be a pool hall.
The nicest pool hall that I've been in, really.
We went in and found Ian's sister Alison sitting with a friend.
We knew her from the cast on her left arm, and we got our signatures right away.
Everyone else from the bus started spilling in after our team was squared away, and as she was signing, I asked Alison how many had been here before us.
Only two, it turned out!
We suspected that it was Kelly and Vlad, but I'm thinking now that she meant two teams.
Still, we thought we were doing great.
But it seemed like everyone who hadn't caught the chaser virus was right there with us, so we got out fast.
I got a couple photos before we did, which prompted someone up front to get on the PA and remind everyone that flash photography was not allowed in the pool hall.
Outside, another chaser was already circling, and so we kept to the safe zone and went back to the bus stop we arrived at.
A couple other players joined us, I think, and another Geary bus came soon.
On it, we met up again with Ian's parents.
Discussing the race (\Shoot
Our conversation was cut short when we got to 6th Avenue, where our team got out and went across the street to catch the 44 into Golden Gate Park.
The 44 bus went right by one end of Middle Drive E, which was considered a safe zone, and we were hoping we could get out right there, but the only stop in the park was by the de Young Museum.
two streets away.
The park was probably the hardest part in the race.
It was already night when we got to the pool hall, you couldn't see a chaser's purple ribbon until it was probably too late.
talk about paranoia.
We walked down the street we were on, thinking we'd stick to the trees as we headed towards Middle Drive E, but we spotted someone walking down Martin Luther King drive and, when he saw us, he never looked away and started texting someone on his phone.
Right into the trees we went.
We ended up in a parking lot, open and vulnerable, but we had no choice to keep going and get across the street at the other end.
We did so without incident, fortunately, the chaser not having circled around to follow us.
One more block to go, and Sean thought we could cut across the construction going on, and I was game to try but wasn't sure.
We ended up going right by and around it, ending up at the entrance to the Shakespeare Garden.
It was closed by a big iron gate, but it wasn't locked, so Sean led the way.
As I was going in, Nicole and I suddenly heard a voice from across the path.
\Do you mind shutting the gate behind you?'
We couldn't see anyone there, but it sounded like someone was sleeping on the ground across the path.
\Sorry
\'S alright.'
Sean had gone around it, but we couldn't see how or where.
I started to go around one way and Nicole the other, when on the other side I saw a silhouette walking right towards me.
Fuck, again.
Sean or chaser?
The silhouette just stood there.
I was tensing up to bolt.
\ I asked
Nicole
Going up the road, Sean found a park map that showed the hidden path (well, hidden in the dark) going up to the circle.
Up a rise and down some stairs, we saw an orange safety cone with a light inside, making it glow, sitting in the middle of a circular opening.
Ian and Evan were there, Evan with a broom.
As Evan signed our manifests, Ian told me he was rooting for our team, really glad that we had made it this far.
We also learned that six people had been here before us, but that some of them were doing the checkpoints in a different order.
I thought that, while clever, it was cheap, probably cheating, and said so.
Ian, in his way, neither confirmed nor denied the legality of such an action.
After some planning of alternate routes, since getting back to the de Young seemed unlikely, Ian warned us that several chasers had been spotted going up and down MLK Drive, and we might want to consider going another way.
We got our streets mixed up (or at least I did) and thought that MLK Drive was the long street to the north, where the Conservatory of Flowers was.
Instead, it was the street where we spotted the chasers from before.
Still, thinking we'd have to exit the other side of the park and get back across elsewhere, we headed out the other side of the circle after getting our next contact (a man with a box of logs), up some stairs, through some trees, across the baseball fields and to Lincoln Avenue, running along the south side of the park.
We walked along the park, as I took the lead and kept an eye out for chasers waiting to jump out at us, but we made it to 9th Avenue and the bus stop for the 44 going north.
Once again, we discussed that bus transfers were killing our time.
I was really paranoid about the number of chasers along the course at this point, and thought best to err on the side of caution.
Nicole was with me, but I think Sean was getting impatient and wanted to take more risks.
I was with the occasional risk, but we had to pick our battles wisely.
In the meantime, the 44 could get us right to Balboa Street, and the Balboa bus could get us right to the fifth safe zone.
Sean agreed and we waited.
And waited.
Nicole pointed out that it was 10:30pm and that the chasers would be called in at 10:45.
Had it really been that long since we started?
I called Ian and told him we were worried about the race ending.
He told us that there would still be chasers out after 10:45 and that we should consider ourselves in play until we reached the beach.
That made me feel better and I let the others know the good news.
I mean, I didn't think we'd get to the beach first at this point, but I didn't want us to be timed-out and disqualified because the busses were slow.
The 44 finally came around 10:40pm and we took it north through the park.
We ended up talking to another guy on his way home, who said he'd help us get to where we were going after I showed him our map and told him we were racing across the city.
But as we got to Fulton Avenue, Sean went to the front of the bus, looked out the side, and motioned for us to get out there.
He was out before we could say anything, and so Nicole and I jumped out the back.
What's going on, what happened to Balboa?
\
 we can grab that.'
\
 the chasers will probably be looking for us that way
If we took the Balboa bus, we'd get in to the safe point without having to deal with them.
\
 and we decided on Balboa before the Fulton bus showed up.'
(I said something like \If we get caught
) The walk to Balboa was uneventful, and we found a bench (a real bench, not the flip-down half-seats other bus stops have) to take a breather on.
Sean seemed okay with this plan when he found out the Balboa bus runs every 15 minutes, so we wouldn't lose too much time.
I made an audio recording on my camera of our situation while we waited, during which an SUV came up and asked directions to the Golden Gate Bridge.
We didn't have to wait too long before the bus arrived, and we found the guy we were talking to on the 44, who said something like, \See?'
Checkpoint 5 and#8213 1640 Balboa Street and#8213 Laundromat
A small laundromat was at the address of the fifth stop.
Orion was there, manning the spot, and we also were reunited with Vlad, Kelly and Avidd.
I was glad to see all of them, until Avidd turned around and we saw that he had a purple ribbon tied around the flower on his jacket.
Orion signed our manifests as the rest of them left, and said, \And before you go
\You're kidding me
\We have to carry a log the rest of the way?'
\How do you think the wood for the fire is going to get to the beach?'
We're tired, and just as we thought the end was in sight, we had to carry extra weight with us.
Sean got a log as well and we left the laundromat.
Outside, Kelly, Vlad, Avidd, and some other guy who was not Maccabee but would later claim to be Maccabee's avatar wanted to know if he could go with us.
He wasn't a chaser, after all.
Avidd warned us that chasers in some sort of yellow buggy had been seen zipping up and down 18th Avenue and that we should be careful, before he slipped off up to 17th to see if he could catch anyone else, leaving us to discuss what we were going to do.
With Avidd's back turned and up the block a bit, we ended up running down to the bus stop at 19th Avenue.
Much deliberation as to what we were doing.
Kelly admitted that they had seen us at other bus stops before this, but weren't sure if we had been turned into chasers or not and they had avoided us totally.
I brought up that bus stops were safe zones, and there was some deliberation as to whether or not \MUNI stations\' (as it said on our manifest) included bus stops
Kelly and Vlad had been playing the whole game assuming bus stops weren't safe, which is pretty impressive that they'd made it as far as they had.
I pointed out that it'd be terribly unfair if you couldn't even wait for a bus in peace in this game.
Avidd returned shortly thereafter to circle like a shark.
At some point, Sean, Vlad and Kelly all decided to run for it, and Avidd took off after them.
Nicole and I figured we'd wait for the bus, get out somewhere in the 30s where there probably weren't any chasers (since the Balboa bus would only get us two blocks from Great Highway, and we figured that'd be some sort of chaser gauntlet at this pointand#8212screw that), get on the 18 bus which would drop us off on the west side of Great Highway, right into safety and the beach.
After a few minutes, Kelly and Vlad returned.
We told them our plan since they were still a whole team and I really wanted them to have a shot at winning.
It turned out Vlad had the same idea at some point.
Avidd showed up again as well, apparently having lost Sean (who later sent me an SMS saying he was on Geary and going to take that bus).
Some more conversation, and Ian showed up on his bike, on his way to visit Orion.
More discussion, and finally the Balboa bus showed up.
Everyone but Ian had every intention to get on that bus, but it passed on by without really slowing down.
Not much to do about that, so Ian went off to visit Orion, and Avidd took off his chaser ribbon, claiming a truce since he just wanted to get to the beach.
We all walked up to Geary (no sign of Sean, but we saw a Geary bus pass us by from half a block away) and waited for the bus there.
And waited.
And Kelly was like, fuck it, and stuck out her thumb.
They got a BMW to stop for them and she and Vlad jumped into the back seat.
I debated Nicole and I joining them but we didn't.
After they took off, the rest of us discussed the legality/creativity around that action (mostly: damn, wish we'd gone with it), and Avidd ended up taking off on foot, maybe to find a cab.
Nicole and I decided to stick to the rules and wait for a bus.
And wait we did, for like half an hour.
I was sullen and cranky, wishing the race had started an hour or two earlier so players wouldn't have to deal with crappy late-night bus schedules.
Then again, that's just part of the race.
Even past that, we were worried about how we'd get back to my car, all the way on the other side of the city, when the busses stopped running.
The Geary bus dropped us off a block from Great Highway.
We went cautiously but directly through a plaza, saw no chasers (mind, it's about 12:20am at this point), and got across to safety.
A couple calls and we knew which fire out of a long string of maybe two dozen fires to go to, and being one of the last to arrive, we added our logs.
Fucking finally.
Reunited with everyone, we fell into many discussions, including the nature of EquivalenZ tasks and how they might seem to have a higher barrier to entry than other teams, and what could be done to fix that.
Nicole took a cab back to her place on her own, and later I ended up catching a cab with Rubin, Nicole and their friend Josh back downtown around 3.
On the way back, we passed a motorcycle with twenty-eleven headlights and mirrors, like something out of Quadrophenia, and I watched the rows and rows of houses go by my window, watching us cover in 20 minutes the same ground we had raced and been pursued across for over four hours.
And to be honest, fell in love with the city all over, once again.
And I don't think anyone noticed that the map we received put San Francisco on the Atlantic Ocean.
We move whole cities here at SF0.
I arrived at the Embarcadero with Sean, Sam, Ian, and Matt at about 5:00 to help set up.
Chairs and tables were placed, bread was bought, and ribbons were cut.
then those of us chasing or working checkpoints headed off out of sight to keep our identities as masked as possible.
Evan and I watched the opening ceremonies from the fountain just down the parkway doing our best to blend into our surroundings when a rush of thirty-something wild-eyed players charged right for us and into the \field.'
Soon after, excess wood was slipped into the back of a van along with a bag full of laundry.
No reason not to get something USEFUL done this evening, right?
There were sheets to wash.
The laundromat at 16th and Balboa somehow managed to be \drab\' while outshining every other storefront in that quiet Inner Richmond neighborhood.'
The only noise, inside or out, was the blaring of techno-twinged classical muzak blaring out of two shoddy speakers mounted to the laundromat's wall and the pacing of an Asian man who, in earnest, was out to clean some clothes.
His pacing grew increasingly nervous as I placed a large box of firewood on a table in the back corner and loaded a bag of white sheets into a machine.
without actually turning it on.
Half an hour later, I placed in some quarters.
Then removed then.
Soon, I bought some detergent and, eventually, my boredom led me to actually START the machine.
I'm sure he'd never seen anyone take that long to start a load of laundry.
It didn't help that I kept having phone conversations about \chasers
he didn't return for his clothes in the dryer until hours later and seemed quite freaked out to find me still there.
still handling those very same sheets and with much less wood than I'd started with.
The first player to enter the laundromat was Rob.
I signed his manifest, congratulated him on his success so far, and handed him a log to be carried to the bonfire on Ocean Beach.
Hot on his heels, the eventual winners entered the laundromat just minutes after Rob had lured all the chasers out of the vicinity.
Eventually, twelve to fifteen players came stumbling into the laundromat, some bewildered to find only a young man doing laundry and others fortunate enough to find me in obvious conversation with other participants.
Not everyone made it out there.
but I'm sure glad for those who did!
The real highlight came towards midnight when a homeless man entered the storefront and promptly removed the pants he was wearing.
Tossing them into a dryer, he glared at me icily as I loaded more firewood into the box behind me.
He must have been cold in his boxer shorts.
but the quarter he spent warming up his pants before heading out back into the night was probably the best twenty-five cents he'd spent in weeks.
Finally, Toom entered the laundromat just at midnight and we made our way to the beach where we enjoyed the tail end of the bonfire.
If you ever want to hear any Russian proverbs about elephants.
or something.
Vlad's your man.
i avoided the chasers by going to the north side of coit tower
after waiting a couple minutes, jason arrived .
we then walked to the second checkpoint
at checkpoint 2, we met up with leslie and yellow rose and then went to catch the bus to the next checkpoint
after waiting a very long time, and realizing that we could have walked there by then, we questioned if the bus was even in service .
yellow rose decided to go home and the rest of us pressed on, choosing to move to a different bus line (that would surely be in service), we caught a bus and started moving along the route again
we got to checkpoint 3 and everyone was bewildered by the questions about the morton salt girl, after we figured that we had missed her (and it not be a complex puzzle), we then had the manager sign off that checkpoint
at this point we knew we were behind schedule and there was little we could do about it .
the transit options were not appealing at this point and we walked to checkpoint 4
we arrived to find that the agents had just left, we had the waitress sign our checkpoint and we went to wait for the bus .
after a while, we decided to walk to the next one, so that we were at least moving along the route
at this point, the bus appeared and we had to hail it down .
it was packed so full that we were forced to push our way in from the back, trying to get off of the stairs so that the bus would move proved to be quite a chalenge
after arriving at checkpoint 5 and seeing the lack of movement, we quickly turned our attention toward food as it was nearing midnight .
around the corner, we found a store where we had our checkpoint signed by the clerk
we then went toward the bus stop, expecting it to be late again .
we were nearly kitty corner when it went past on time
with the next bus a few minutes away, we decided to walk to checkpoint 6 .
when we got there, a wooded area with no sign of life, i yelled 'charlies in the trees' and got no response
after concluding we were really late, and that  we needed to go that way instead of this way,  a stranger walked past .
as we were starting to walk away, a lightbulb turned on and we asked him to sign the checkpoint
at this point we walked to the marina, meeting up with lowteck as he was leaving .
Disease has always been part of human life.
Even now, members of our population still suffer from the occasional ailment.
Medibots still search for cures to nanocancer and scarring around steamshunts.
But in previous years, before the Singularity or even the invention of ----, disease was not simply a inconvenience, but could actually lead to loss of life.
In fact, millions of humans died in epidemics that swept the earth.
Although most computer records were lost in the Robot Revolution of 2070, researchers were able to piece together the basics of early diseases using artifacts called â??books,â? in which information is written in a static and linear fashion on fragile sheets of wood pulp.
Through these artifacts, researchers gathered information about epidemics of â??plague,â? â??yellow feverâ? and of course, the dreaded â??Red Death.
â?  
First mentioned in a monograph by noted scientist Edgar Allen Poe, the red death was feared for the speed with which is stuck, and the inevitably fatal results of infection.
The first and only symptom of the disease was described by Poe as â??scarlet stains upon the bodyâ?.
Later observers mention seeing â??a flash of redâ? or â??a band of red around one arm.
â?  According to contemporary scientists, simply touching someone who had a red band was enough to become infected.
The disease spread so quickly that the infected rapidly became known as â??Chasers,â? while those still healthy referred to themselves as â??Runners.
â?   Cities with large populations and airports were particularly hard hit:  San Francisco, Chicago, even Minneapolis suffered from infections that swept the populace.
A manuscript detailing an encounter with the Red Death was recently recovered from an early human-era â??intarweb.
â?  Footnotes are attached to explain obscure references.
\Last night was Journey to the End of the Night (1)

Myrna
Myrna Minx wanted to man Checkpoint 2.
And so it was.
Myrna called Lincoln with the idea that she would be in a tuxedo and he'd be wearing a cocktail dress, \fishing\' on Lake Merritt.'
Â  Lincoln decided to do a completion of Donation By Other Means with every runner that came through the checkpoint.
So Lincoln photographed every runner that came through the checkpoint.
248 runners began the race.
182 made it to Checkpoint 2.
The first runners to arrive were given the charge of finding suitable \fishing poles.'
Â  Some runners were asked to tell fishermen's tales, and finally, as the checkpoint became very busy, many runners were just asked to submit their souls to the camera and forego the telling of tales or any other form of delay.
Lincoln recorded most of the people's names as they came through so we'd have names to go with the faces.
Watching the sunset and lights come on on Lake Merritt was a lovely way to experience Journey to the End of the Night as staff members.
Â  It was fun meeting everyone and we hope to see you at the next one.
If you hit the + larger button below you can hear a recording that was made at the time the photos were taken while you look at the photos that follow.
The catchers are still out there.
They are still after us.
One of these days, one of these arms in the crowd will flash a red ribbon and we will run like hell.
2011 ff
When we have rested as much as we can allow us, we leave the last safe zone.
My hand that nervously clinges to the blue ribbon is sweating.
We knew this was just the training.
From now on, in this year and the many that will follow, there will be no safe zones.
02:15
It is a volatile atmosphere in the common space where the awards are handed out.
There are thirty of us left, fourteen teams.
From a hundred and fifty faces that we barely saw more than once, the greatest part has been eliminated, brainwashed, made catcher.
The catchers are the ones cheering and laughing, celebrating the transient victory we aren't able to appreciate.
23:30
proof:7, size:60, align:center
we made it, and one team after us.
we do not know what happened to the others.
The door opens, and stumbling into the dark corridor behind, we realize that we made it.
But at what price?
The image of Rubin being assaulted by the dark shadow is burning in the back of my head.
Lyx half carries me up the last flight of stairs, to where the others are gathering.
Runners and catchers alike.
23:10
I hiss: Run!
Straight on!
-  I barely saw the dark shadow on the other side of the street, a movement, a flash of red, and a figure struggling to get away.
It is just one more block until we reach the safe zone.
I want to avert my eyes from the scene, but I have to look.
I have to make sure we won't be the next.
And the face of the victim is so.
22:55

The dark protects you - the dark hunts you down.
We know we are getting late.
Too late, maybe.
The last checkpoint has been almost deserted.
But the city is getting more dangerous, now that we are so close to the goal.
They are getting more and more.
We cannot risk it like that.
Our legs are hurting, and I know lyx' nerves are on edge when she tells me she won't run.
That she would hold them up, just so that one of us can make it.
22:45
The couch is the checkpoint.
The guardians are about to leave, to desert the safe zone just as we arrive.
But they give us a last chance, and their signature.
The others meet a friend that has been waiting for them, but now she is one of them.
We sneak away in the other direction while she is talking.
Each time we get away like that, the rush of success becomes less strong, and the bitter aftertaste of repetition stronger.
Our luck won't last forever.
22:30
Now we know why the chaser didn't follow us out of the safe zone.
We took the wrong way around the castle.
At least we got rid of her, and we have already scouted the yards and gates of the old building earlier today.
So we can cut right through it, and through the museum quarter as well.
We end up in an alley half way to the safe zone.
Again, we are slow, but silent, and most importantly alone.
A bus stops near us, and we ride it for a few stations.
We cross the other bridge, where they wouldn't wait for us.
A street doesn't go through, and we improvise, but we reach the next zone.
22:10
(copyrighted picture)
The upper class.
Just a station to pass.
The checkpoint is on an exposed platform, up a flight of stairs.
They taunt us latecomers by acting their part extra slow.
They are snobbish.
They ask us how to dress.
As if that was of any importance for the hunted class.
The place is swarming with chasers, to gobble up those who remain, those who carelessly step out of the safe zone.
22:00
A moment ago we were smirking, laughing about their blunder to wait at a public tram station in plain sight.
If we had been chasers, not runners, hiding here in the shadow, all five of them would be down before they realized what happened.
A moment later, we realize how little better we are.
There are two of them in the tram.
There is no way we could escape them.
It is just sheer luck that they are as new to the game as we are, and trying to stay out of our sight while we are safe in the vehicle.
So we stay out of theirs.
A third chaser boarding the tram distracts them for a moment, and while the doors are closing, we are out - early.
And again we are on foot, on the run.
21:40
After a walk that feels like an eternity, we reach the third zone.
-But wait- the zone starts on the other side of the plaza.
Nobody is acting suspicious, and everybody is acting like they are not.
We do cross the place safely, and still no one in sight, red ribbon or blue.
Where is the checkpoint?
After a while, we find a runner.
Once again, we have to ask for help.
But it feels good as long as you have someone to ask for help.
At the checkpoint, they ask if we want to be heroes.
Maybe that is what it feels like.
Are they chasing us, because we are stronger, deadlier, more silent?
Aren't we running because we know better?
21:20
We run out of the second safe zone.
We circle a corner, tag-boom.
If my ribbon was a hint more reddish, these three would be dead.
If theirs were red, we would be.
We nod, and smile, and both sides decide that it is a good idea to leave the others as a beacon, to trail off in the direction they wanted to go anyway.
It is a long journey to zone three.
21:00

What good is a teleporter without destination?
We leave the safe zone on a remoter side.
Just outside the safe zone, we come across a teleporter.
We know we aren't supposed to use the teleporters.
Lyx tries to make sense of the controls, and we end up in another empty street.
Not much closer to zone two.
We keep running.
My evidencer breaks, just as I am trying to take a picture of a GÃ¶del memorial.
He has got a sense of humour, this breaker of systems.
We again try to stay safe, and take the back alleys to the safe zones.
There won't be chasers in the back alleys, not this early in the game.
Hopefully.
20:50
At the first checkpoint, we have to create a tool to save the world.
Most of us still believe in that.
The guardians inspect our work, and put their sign of approval on our piece of paper.
Then they collect the tools, and melt them down.
They send us on our way and ask the next person to do the same task again.
We - we run.
20:40
proof:5, size:60, align:center
Do they want these tools, or is this a test?
They tell us, they didn't see anyone with a ribbon.
We think they are just passers-by.
But we put our trust in their eyes and memory and dive into the small passageway between the houses.
A wary look behind each column, each of the small yards we pass.
The safe zone is the road on the other side.
20:30
The chase begins.
The road we are on is safe.
The safe zones are safe.
We are not.
So we try to get away from the others.
Further away, we enter a network of alleys, all alike.
Each intersection brings us closer to the first checkpoint, each distant figure instils another drop into the fragile phial that contains our paranoia.
A few minutes ago we were joking, cheering, looking forward to the rush that awaits us.
20:05
proof:3, size:60, align:center
They are smiling at us like a dog at a flock of birds.
The announcer raises the megaphone.
He reads the rules.
He introduces us to some of our chasers.
Our chasers.
We applaud.
Everyone gets two ribbons.
One is blue, to wear on your arm, to surrender when you are tagged, at which point you become one of them.
A red ribbon.
We get a map, barely a sketch, and a hint.
Are we ready?
19:30
This is it.
The Journey.
We have been preparing for almost a year.
We have been talking about this ever since Leif told us about the event.
We have travelled in cheap buses just to be here, part of the selected few that dare to be runners today.
The others have done the same, and everyone is laughing, cheering.
Joking with the chasers that surround us, smiling as the chasers do.
A careless smile on our side.
A calculated one on their faces.
We will be part of this.
Witness some 200+ people on the Embarcadero.
(It was more than 500+!
All sorts of costumes, some certainly not for the running in.
Enter we, 2 cats set to prowl.
I (Ombwah) and Bun Bun Meow, appropriately attired began our Journey on the BART all the way in to the Embarcadero.
We arrived just in time to get one of the very last sign in sheets, as the park was thronged with costumed runners-to-be.
It was very Loud too!
I found it particularly neat to look around knowing what was going on and Noticing the shall I say Innocent Bystanders watching in awe and wondering what was happening.
For some, I think that curiousity got the better of them and they came to ask us, the two cats.
How appropriate.
One gent in particular I remember approaching us, and we moments later saw him in Line to get His ribbons.
WOOt, wonder if he enjoyed how he chose to spend His halloween.
The first leg was just a brisk jog along the closed Bay Bridge and voila!
Not too stressful, as I passed a member of the erstwhile SFPD I caught his CB squawking \Are we still watching that group of - more than 200 in the park?'
We asked each other aloud if we should jump up this alleyway, and the cop shouted after us \Just stay off the bridge!'
Check point one had only a few narrow exits and I was tagged shortly upon exiting.
I was texting Bun Bun to tell her to run-run when she called me to report being tagged a couple of blocks on.
Just A BRISK JOG?
meows in surprise  Brisk jog INdeed!
I in fact found the first leg the most painful and Scary at the same time.
I think I realized then I better control my breathing or I was in trouble.
This was also when we were first seperated.
I had to then choose to seek to meet back up by lingering Or just run for the checkpoint.
I ducked behind a building in the end, and spotted me kitty partner coming my way soon after.
At the checkpoint, I really wished to stay a spot longer to catch my breath.
But the prowling chasers Milling about made us to skittish.
And not but a block away the very couple that scared us off tagged Ombwah, Im thinking maybe it was their plan all along.
After I lost me partner I slipped around the corner and spotted my chance to bolt.
I made it two short blocks, lol.
In the End I PRobably was the EASIEST prey of the night.
As I dodged one chaser, Literally to FALL into the arms of another.
See attached Pic of the bruise from his awesome catch.
To that guy.
\No hard feelings
winks
As we went to meet I came upon a group of three runners walking toward where I knew Bun to be, and they saw me.
The classic recognition-break-dash ensued and I hear one of them exclaim \Chaser!'
I smiled and said Happy Halloween.
And proceeded to cross, at the walk signal of course.
giggles I truly Hope though that  NO ONE was hurt.
The costume party was a three-way tie - The Ringmaster, The Scottish Dude and The Linux Penguin pulled a ro-sham-bo to see who got to keep the trophy.
Aye, The Ringmaster with the smashing Hat.
and I think the \Scottish Dude\' was  more specifically an officer of sorts.'
Which I think honestly was the winner.
There were certainly a couple more \worthy\' costumes in the place also.'
But no one wanted to come up.
Alas, maybe it was that once ye sat down, one did not want to get back up.
giggles  Being the timid kat I am, I let Ombwah do the talking when the microphone got to us.
But we had put a LOT of heart into our costumes being the prowlers that we were, and I wanted to show it.
But this kitty does not like the spotlight at all.
(hate cameras) I would have liked to get a better look at that trophy though.
I apologize for the blurry pictures, though maybe that's more correct, the whole night was a blurred stuttering experience of flashes and long spooling scenes.
The city is smaller than I had perceived before, and so full of art - there are drawings everywhere.
I got street tacos on the way back to BART and the night spiraled to a close.
I swear people yelled, \Chasers!'
My partner in crime thought it was better to take unknown alleyways and cut through parking lots, while I think the better strategy would be to be in the front of the herd and never fall behind.
But maybe that's only my bitterness at being tagged at Checkpoint 2.
If someone had told me that I would be participating in a large zombified version of tag, I would have told them that the night sounds terrible.
I think running around the track once is an accomplishment.
Yet, the adrenaline, fun, other players (mostly strange-rs), and strategy kept me going.
Next time I'll know to bring my running shoes.
My experience of Journey to the end of the night began the day after my return to London from foreign climates.
Mouse invited me to be a part of the group organizing the game.
So, I meet Mouse in London, by the BFI and off we go, trekking around London scouting out possible locations for the checkpoints.
This took us nearly 4 hours but it was great fun trying to double guess potential players and trying to find where we should place chasers or routes that would create bottlenecks and killing fields.
And that was that until the day of the game.
The game came round and we, the chasers, were briefed and put in our positions ready to start.
The highlight of this part was marching past the queuing players trying to look as menacing as possible.
I have a feeling we failed miserably seen as many giggles came our way.
And then I waited and waited and waited.
The players were taking it slow and many werenâ??t taking their decisions that seriously yet thus were not going down the triple guess root.
They were in fact going in the most obvious route possible which naturally we werenâ??t prepared for.
I did see a few players though.
I waited, peeking at them from around a pillar until they got closer.
And then I pounced!
And they froze!
Shit â?¦ here I am running full pelt at a group of frozen players who, if im being honest, I didnt want to catch yet.
That would have just spoilt the game for them.
What the hell do I do!
Luckily a bit of shouting managed to get rid of their â??caught in the headlights syndromeâ??.
They scattered and I fulfilled my task of splitting up friends, spouses or whatever they were.
So, back to waiting.
A few more minutes and I got another small group my way.
Guess what.
The same thing happened!
I think I might have to work on my scary face or something.
After this I moved onto The Third checkpoint and yet again waited.
What was reassuring about this place though was that it seemed like every designated chaser was there and no one had passed through the checkpoint yet.
So an ambush was guarantied no mater how long we had to wait.
And was it an ambush and a half!
I aloud myself to start the â??killingâ?? now and my god was it fun!
I did get some very dodgy looks from the general public though.
Especially when I chased a teenage girl around the block (She was playingâ?¦ I donâ??t actually belong in prison).
Even better expressions came about when we started to have a civilized conversation after I managed to catch her.
We began to debate whether she could legitimately go for a drink with her friends even though she was now a catcher (note that we are in England and drink is a part of everything we do, even city wide tag).
I thought that the game has good heartedness at its core and therefore couldnâ??t see the problem with her joining her friends.
All that was needed was a gentlemanâ??s agreement and that was it.
The ambush continued and I caught another two players, I did let one of them go though seen as he was SOOOO close to the safe zone.
Hey, itâ??s not about my tally is it, itâ??s about the punters having fun.
I then decided to move on to the second to last check point, which was Hyde Park.
The mother of all killing fields, made even scarier by the fact that it was pitch-black!
This was great, a bit inactive at parts, but truly outstanding in others.
Highlights included:
â?¢ Running into a tree.
â?¢ Discovering a â??cruisingâ?? ground.
â?¢ Avoiding said â??cruising groundâ?? like the plague.
â?¢ Not being able to tell if people were players or public until the very last moment.
o This caused one great moment when three of us realised when we were about a foot away from each other and ended up in a pile.
But a pile involves contact, so by my book they were caught.
The game started to wind down here, so we chilled out at the checkpoint and staged the chaser/player handshake.
And then I went for a drink!
Introduction
For most of us, the completions of some tasks are always a joy to read.
Even the not-very-good proofs are engaging and fun.
Other tasks seem doomed to be eternally uninteresting.
'Why would anyone want to read that,' we wonder.
I've never met an Object Annotation or a Seeing Beyond Sight completion that I didn't love.
The worst ones are always interesting and vote-worthy.
At the same time, I've yet to find a One Blank White Card or Journey praxis that held my interest until the end.
This despite a long list of elaborate, beautifully written, carefully documented completions by some of my favorite players.
Like travel writing, I just don't get Journey write-ups.
Perhaps it's because in both cases the thing itself is so much better than any written description, and thus the text always feels dull and lifeless.
Or perhaps that's just a lame rationalization for a senseless emotional response.
Whatever the reason, it puts me in the novel position of submitting a praxis for which I not only wouldn't vote, but which I probably wouldn't even read.
None the less the event was great fun, and it would seem rude not to document it and thus congratulate and thank the people who made it happen.
Oh, and also, who's gonna turn down a free 50 points for doing notmuch?
Gotta level up somehow.
(In Los Angeles, they got gold just growing on the trees, man.
All you gotta do is reach out and take it.
)
The event, and the stuff I did, and some stuff I didn't do.
I traveled from San Francisco to Los Angeles with Lowteck, Lank, and Sturm und Drang in Lowteck's car for this event.
Saturday afternoon I met up with Lincoln and C.
in Hollywood and kept them company while they put the finishing touches on the last few Journey preparations.
I originally planned to run or chase, but cancellations and a badly timed theater production left the organizers short on checkpoint crew, so I was given dominion over Checkpoint 5.
Non-player Nancy and I were stationed on the patio of El Gran Burrito, a fantastic 24 hour taqueria, where we offered final signatures and free burritos to runners before their sprint to the finish line.
Since our checkpoint was 90% of the way to the end of the race, it took several hours for the first live runners to arrive.
Nancy and I chatted, munched fantastic $1 tacos, and watched a fair sample of the population of Los Angeles pass through the restaurant patio.
A non-player friend of mine stopped by to hang out and visit for a bit to keep us company.
Just over an hour into the game, our first player came through.
Lefthandedsnail, a runner who'd been nabbed by the bicycle chaser early on in the game, decided to stake out checkpoint five as a chaser.
She and her satchel of tasking supplies kept us fine company while we waited for runners to arrive.
Over the next few hours several additional chasers arrived and began distributing themselves along the city blocks surrounding our checkpoint.
Finally, at almost midnight, the first batch of live runners rushed in.
They sipped sodas, collected signatures, and carefully planned their next move.
Only a few blocks from the finish line and surrounded on all sides by chasers, they spent a long time devising exit strategies while chasers swept past the chain link fence and taunted them.
Meanwhile, the checkpoint staff struggled to remain neutral and tried to avoid aiding either side.
I screwed up once and foiled a stand-off between two runners and two chasers pacing each other across the safe-zone by distracting one of the chasers with conversation.
Whoever you were, I'm sorry.
We also spoke with the taqueria security and manager a couple of times.
They were pretty relaxed and willing to let us have our fun, once we convinced them the gangs of weirdly dressed youths taunting each other across a chain-link fence were playing a friendly game and not preparing for a bloody street fight.
(The security guard was pretty cool actually - I think he got a kick out of the whole thing.
)

 
By about 12:45 we decided that everyone still in the race had made it through our checkpoint and headed to the party at the finish line.
Deep insights, profound truths, and cheap shots.
I really enjoyed meeting a bunch of players.
Not only El Capitan, whom I've been jonesing to meet since I was a wee n00b, and MKII, whom I'd always assumed was a sock puppet, but also a long list of fantastic newer players, several clearly showing the early signs of chronic drive.
I have a suspicion that LA0 is going to become a praxis powerhouse in the coming months.
Lincoln and C.
did a fantastic job organizing things, and I'm grateful to everyone else who pitched in and made the event happen.
Thank you all.
It was well worth the trip.
On the structure of the game itself, I haven't much to say.
We came up with a hand full of ideas for future variations on the Journey theme that could be interesting, but the basic pattern hammered out in previous Journeys seems to work quite well.
Two or three people were a tad disappointed that there weren't any hidden secrets revealed as the game progressed having a couple easter eggs along the route might add a bit of spice to future games.
There were a couple disputes involving restrictions on chasers, and at least two runners were in favor of handicapping the bicycle chaser in some way.
Several people debated whether or not public transit should have been allowed, but I didn't hear any clear consensus on the matter.
On the whole, things went very smoothly.
The race was challenging but not overly so, with a satisfying number of captures, and a decent runner/chaser ratio.
As far as the city goes, I'm told by otherwise reliable witnesses that there are many things in Los Angeles which are not horrible.
They may be correct.
As an existence proof, I can tell you with certainty that there are some fantastic people there, as well as the best tacos in the US and the best burritos in the observable universe.
They also run a mean street game.
I heartily recommend that anyone with time to spare join us for next year's Journey LA.
(Spidere)
Going into it, we each had a different plan.
Eccoglyph was to be a master of disguise.
The Orange Magister would come from an unexpected direction.
Neil the Ethical Werewolf is fleet of foot.
Ashley planned to relax and enjoy the trip across SF.
Mine, ironically, was to become an information mole when I inevitably got caught by chasers.
I won't spoil their writeups (especially Eccoglyph's), but I think none of us got exactly what we expected.
As a strategist, it made sense to arrive early.
As a planner, it made sense to come prepared (with a GPS, a bus map, flashlight, dark clothing, and of course juice and warm clothes).
As a tactician, it made sense to know the terrain.
As a maker of alliances, it made sense to contact an ally.
And so, my first move after receiving the map was to call in to a beautiful and talented confederate on the east coast, to look up the GPS coordinates of each of the stops for me to input into my GPS.
As it turned out, when a chaser is coming after you, it is very handy to know you must turn /right/ to enter the safe zone.
I kept my GPS unit with me the entire way while a map is really more handy to see the streets, the GPS gave a great after-the-fact trail of the path I took throughout the city.
And what a path it was.
After the initial whistle was blown, the crowd was off.
Rather than be a part of the chaser-bait, Ashley, Neil and I enjoyed an energy-providing repart before setting off for the stairs (it helps to have an SF native along).
As we were approaching the base, a man walked by, walking his dog.
He slowed.
Then stopped, and turned his head to stare at us.
We froze.
In a perfect movie moment, he slowly drew back his sleeve.
revealing a red ribbon.
We bolted from the chaser, a burst of energy that would haunt us when we returned to the steps, as well as hours later.
But eventually, we made it to the top, and even ran into the Magister.
We snapped a few photos, then went down the back towards our next stop.
Just before we reached it, a man started running across the street.
Neil took off running back, distracting the chaser, who took off in pursuit.
Ashley and I took advantage of the lure and bolted for the safe zone.
A little later, Neil had escaped, doubled back, and met us at checkpoint 2.
Here, we joined up with the Magister, as well as two others (Ramon and Anna).
We planned a fairly short but hopefully safe route to checkpoint 3, then started walking.
At one point, we came across a couple more players.
As we were walking, I saw one of the two players sleeves pull up.
revealing a red and white ribbon.
By this time, they were in the middle of our group, with Neil and Ramon ahead, the rest of us behind.
'Neil--run!
' I called and we all scattered, fleeing from the chaser in our midst.
As it later turned out, Neil and Ramon were caught there but only one of the two was actually a chaser--the other was wearing her blue ribbon, bait and disguise for players like us.
When they realized this, Neil and Ramone began an undead mission of vengeance: to find the bait, and ensure that she too was chased and caught.
Anna and I fled in mostly the same direction (you can see onthe gps track how we doubled back and ran to the south).
We ran into chaser number 4, and hid, then were chased again I turned a corner and ducked away, she made it to a bus stop.
Both of us safe for now, we also met up with Ashley and tentatively made our way to checkpoint 3.
Along the way, every pedestrian seemed like a potential chaser.
No one could be trusted.
We moved to the opposite side of the road, we spaced ourselves, we gave every passerby a good distance.
At checkpoint 3, we ran into the Magister yet again, who rejoined our party.
We also received a surprise--Eccoglyph had beaten us there!
Our broken path evasion of chasers and delays to regroup seemed to be costing us, so we went to Sacramento to catch a 1 bus west.
at the bus stop, we found two more players-turned-chasers.
Having made it into the safe zone, we started chatting, and it turned out they had objects of power!
They'd forgotten to use them when they got caught, but generously gave them to us in hopes that they might help.
And they would!
For soon after checkpoint 4 (with Anna having departed), a chaser leapt up the ramp and tagged Ashley.
'wait!
' she cried--but he was already running after me (and before I could cover the half block to the safe zone, I too was tagged).
Fortunately, the 'get out of jail free card' allowed us 60 seconds of free time to escape, which we used to run east (away from the direction we needed to go), to a 38 stop.
Seconds after reaching it, the chaser showed up again we'd just made it.
from here, it was a straight shot west.
At a later stop, a horde of chasers got on the bus.
This was trouble--even though the stops were safe, they could just wait us out.
so we left a stop early, betting on speed to get us to the next checkpoint.
The arrival was fairly uneventful there were several chasers just hanging out at the house, but apparently those on the bus had other plans.
We rested up and chatted for a while.
At this point, Ashley and I knew that Neil, Eccoglyph, and now the Magister had all been tagged.
Our duty was to make it to the end.
With only one checkpoint to go, we wanted to make sure that we survived.
We had to avoid any more chasers.
and so we decided to walk all the way back to Divisadero and go north, then come into the park on the 43 to the 29, straight into the safe zone.
We figured that there was no way a chaser would be back that far.
And in that, we were correct.
It may have cost us an extra hour or more (check out the huge detour between 5 and 6), but we made it to 6 without being caught.
And from there, a relatively quick walk up to Marina and to the end.
When we made it, it was almost 1 AM.
We were late.
We were tired.
we were probably the very last ones to arrive.
But we had made it.
We had survived.
Josh graciously gave over the stamina prize to Ashley, and we hung out, meeting some of the great people here on sf0.
It was a fantastic adventure, and we had an amazing time.
(Eccoglyph)
Spidere's writeup is fantastic!
I'll just add in my own personal experiences as I traveled seperately from my group.
Last year's descriptions revealed that chasers often had trouble identifying people in play, especially after dark when ribbons didn't stand out.
So I figured if I could make myself blend into the landscape, maybe I could sneak by the chasers.
I am an avid costumer, a 'master of disguise' as Spidere puts it, and I rarely pass up an opportunity to make use of it.
I decided people would avoid looking too closely at a homeless character â?? we do have a tendency to avoid certain realities.
A key point to the costume was that it had to be easily removed, as I didn't want to be seen in costume signing into checkpoints.
I fell even deeper into a paranoid state and expected people might get suspicious of the same character showing up near every checkpoint, so I put together multiple costumes.
In the end, I had a homeless character, a goth girl, and I went to the meeting place as a platinum blonde.
Wonder if a psychologist would say something about my affinity for creating alternate personas.
I met up with my friends, Spidere Warmouse, Ashley, Neil Werewolf, and the Orange Magister at the meeting place in my blonde wig, and a few of us went to grab some food at the Ferry Building.
Not many choices on a Saturday and service was a bit slow, so I was heading back to the lawn when I saw the explosive scatter of black-clad figures on the lawn.
Missed the start.
I bolted back to the cafe, warned my friends and ducked into the ladies restroom.
There were many people in the bathroom, so I decided emerging from the stall as a bearded vagrant wouldn't be wise.
Granted, the beard was a cheap plastic wig on my face, but what would it matter upon first glance?
So I put on my pajama pants, Russian ear flap hat, bedsheet, gloves, and threw my backpack into my laundry bag.
I walked up to the sink and used the mirror to properly place the beard so the women could see I wasn't a man.
They still gave me odd looks, but I think they were more confused than frightened, except for that one woman who walked in as I was trying to leave.
However, when I went to meet up with my friends in the cafÃ© and take some pictures, one of the cafÃ© workers followed me outside asking if I needed anything â?? if I was hungry.
He may have thought I was bothering his clientele or else he was just that nice.
I told him I didn't need anything, but I was kind of shocked that he actually thought I looked genuine.
I had a brief hope that maybe I could pull this off.
I headed off to the first checkpoint.
#1) I am embarrassed to say that I had no idea how to approach Coit Tower, though I work fairly close to the area.
I headed up Embarcadero, and was at first amused that people were giving me a wide berth.
After awhile, it wasn't so funnyâ?¦ I actually felt extremely isolated, and whereas I had hung my head to keep people from seeing my face at first, I was finding it difficult to look people in the face.
I ended up circling the hill a bit before finding the winding way up.
I didn't see any chasers, probably because they were already at checkpoint #2.
I passed the Magister on his way back down, and he gave me a knowing grin as he passed.
Thankfully, my grin was hidden behind my horribly fake beard.
Once at the tower, I hit my first snag.
Where in the world would I change?
There were tourists everywhere!
My goth girl backup costume could change in restrooms but I didn't think my current character could, especially not the women's restroom.
I wandered the tower and spotted the contacts â?? then turned around to find an isolated spot to change, kicking myself for not fully considering this situation.
I quickly threw off the sheet, the pajama pants, the beard and hat, and tossed them all in my backpack.
I then ran over to the contacts, who told me I was bringing up the rear, #70-something.
Didn't seem like the costume was helping any.
I headed back to a vacant area and quickly threw the costume back on.
Grumbling, I headed at a quick hobble to checkpoint #2.
#2 â?? Checkpoint 2 was outside on a street â?? lovely.
Where to changeâ?¦ I hobbled past the contact couple and turned into a small side street.
Threw off the pajamas, sheet, etc.
, left the bag of stuff in the alley, already growing tired of the changing act, and headed to get my manifest signed.
As I was getting it signed, the couple asked if I had just walked by in a sheet.
I was amused that they had been paying attention, and I learned the woman had recognized that I was female from my sneakers.
I love my Sketchers, and I didn't want to buy a pair of used sneakers that weren't broken in for such a ground-intensive event.
They wished me luck and I went back into the alley, and changed into my outfit, again.
The beard was really getting on my nerves now.
I kept trying to adjust it by using store windows as mirrors.
#3 â?? The supermarket.
Approaching the supermarket, I could tell things were different.
There were chasers everywhere.
Even in my costume, I didn't feel like walking right through them and drawing their attention.
So I walked past the supermarket, and jaywalked across the road to enter the parking lot.
Safe, I thought.
Nowâ?¦ that darn changing problem, again!
I went into the supermarket, hoping the employees would ignore me.
I went into a corner of the market and changed quickly, then went off to find a woman with an umbrella.
After walking the parking lot a bit and heading back in, a random shopper saw me searching and pointed me towards the back.
'That way,' he said, clearly having had some encounter during his shopping experience.
I wish I had asked.
Bu tthere was the woman with an umbrella and a shopping cart mostly filled with salt.
Got my manifest signed, found out I was right in the thick of the players, and headed towards the entrance.
There were my friends in the parking lot!
I was surprised that I had caught up, and they shared with me stories of chasers and adventure.
They also told me that Neil, who I had expected to outrun everyone in this game, had been caught by an act of treachery.
Shoot â?? not the kind of person you want as a chaser.
I also met this really nice guy named Rabbit.
We looked out at the parking lot together, at the scores of chasers surrounding it, and felt rather powerless.
I told him I had to go back in and get ready.
He came with me as I changed into my costume.
I didn't mind showing him my secret as I felt some bond of camaraderie, both of us facing incredible odds, on the same side.
He also changed his outfit as much as he could.
I didn't want to deal with my beard anymore, so I covered my face with the sheet, wished Rabbit the best of luck, and headed into the fire.
#4 â?? I had no trouble leaving checkpoint 3, but I didn't want to take a direct route to #4, now that I knew the chasers were all over.
I walked on a parallel street, and turned the corner to head in towards the safe zone.
I saw a guy in black at the corner of the safe zone, talking loudly into a cellphone and gesticulating wildly, in my direction, and towards the checkpoint.
I turned around, heart beating loudly, and continued walking along the route.
Maybe if I came in from the other direction?
So I walked along, and I could hear someone walking quickly behind me, catching up.
I stepped aside on the sidewalk to let him pass.
He walked on past, and I continued behind him.
He then turned around and addressed me directly â?? could I give him directions to Denny's?
Oh hell, I thought.
Is this guy a chaser?
I felt a stab of panic, and tried to make my voice sound gruff, forgetting that I was no longer wearing my beard and he could probably tell I was a girl.
I mumbled something about 'No' and 'Pumpkin seeds' (Ok, I panicked) and went past him shaking my head.
He was pretty persistent for awhile before he backed off.
I found out later that this was one of the organizers, Orion.
I felt very nervous as I continued into the safe zone.
I was shocked to have made it in, and ducked into a wall crevice, stripped off the sheet, left the bags, and walked towards the address.
I was getting used to leaving my stuff on the street now.
I was in the safezone but I was so paranoid that when a chaser followed me, I turned abruptly into an open door and ended up in some storage area for a restaurant.
I headed up the stairs and waited for a couple of minutes, eyeing the boxes of fruit all around, trying to slow my heart and basking in the adrenaline rush.
I headed back down and found the address â?? hey look, I thought.
That confirmed my suspicions of the interrogating chaser on my way over.
I went in, found the guy in the orange shirt, and got my manifest signed.
In turn, I signed a cast.
:-) I met Sam there, who was still in the game, and we headed out together.
As we exited, I saw Neil with a bunch of other chasers and I froze, then ducked behind a pillar.
After getting over the initial panic, Sam and I walked away from the group and stopped when we reached my bags.
I told him I needed to change as we wished each other luck and he headed off to #5.
He did far better than I did.
I was maybe a block away from the safe zone hobbling quickly away when I heard feet pounding on the pavement behind me.
'Don't run,' I thought to myself, 'It might be someone running from a chaserâ?¦ they'll run on past-' and then I felt two hands slap me on the back.
Frick again.
I turned around and found myself looking straight at Rabbit.
Not that sweet guy from the supermarket!
The first words out of my mouth were, 'You got caught?
' So much for camaraderie.
Guess I should have been more careful about hiding my identity.
I was disappointed that I hadn't made it to the end, and disappointed that I didn't get to try out my goth outfit, but I was glad that I hadn't become so paranoid that I avoided meeting people.
I exchanged the blue ribbon for a red, and figured I'd head to checkpoint 6 and stop people at the end.
Not much more to the story now.
I thought I could use my outfit to get close to people, but after about 15 minutes of walking through empty streets, I started to feel wigged out.
I took off the sheet and continued.
Finally I called the Magister and found out he had just gotten caught.
Mixed feelings for me on that one â?? yay that now I had someone with whom to travel on the creepy streets, but I was sorry he hadn't made it to the end.
I'll let the Magister tell you his story.
We still had two friends in the game, though, Spidere and Ash, and they did end up making it, though they were the last ones to the endpoint.
On our way to #6, the Magister and I ran into a man with a jealous, extremely affectionate golden retriever puppy.
We got to #6, met the contacts and took pictures with the owl: 

We also ran into Neil on his mission of vengeance, the Magister caught a player, who wasn't quick enough like his female companion to jet to the bus stop.
We got to the party pretty late, after the awards, and passed some players who were turning in early.
I met Orion, who was thrilled to find out that he hadn't interrogated an actual homeless guy.
Seems he had strong suspicions that I was a player, but was thankfully amused enough to let me go.
People crashed at the Magister's place in Berkeley, being thoroughly spent, and got some much-deserved rest.
Spidere and I have already begun talking about how to organize a Journey in DC.
Clearly the event is a hit when participants want it to spread.
Dax, Qarly and I teamed up for team Don't Lose.
Qarly quickly got separated on our way to Coit Tower and unfortunately due to misunderstanding (I thought she had been tagged!
) Dax and I were on our own for awhile.
After quite a bit of chasing, he finally got nailed in front of Calla, while I went in and visited the Salt girl.
A quick change of attire and I was able to walk out of the parking lot undetected.
I slowly made my way across town on the packed 38 bus.
When I got off at the stop near Denny's I was lazy and turned a corner without looking and ran straight into Orion.
Oh well It was still a ton of fun and it was great to make it all the way out to the Wave Organ via car rather than the long walk.
:)  Thanks again everyone for putting this on!
Note: I'm attaching just a few of my favorite pictures here, in low resolution this is to avoid overloading you with images.

My Job
(as I chose to accept it)
I was staff photographer.
I've always felt that Journey has some amazing chases: moments where you have that primal experience of predator or prey, of flight and pursuit.
Unfortunately, in that situation, neither the runner nor the chaser has the time or the incentive to whip out their camera and capture the moment, so there have never really been any good authentic chase pictures.
My job was to travel the route and make sure to capture some of these moments.
I thought that this would be easy.
I mean, really--how hard could it be?
I ended up running more for this Journey than for any other I've been in.
I hadn't realized, when planning this role, that I had to find the action, wherever it was happening, and I had to get there.
In fact, to really get good shots, I had to get there before the action started so, really, I just had to look into the future, with enough time to run to the right place.
I didn't just need to spot people and take pictures I had to not only catch up to them, but get ahead of them, in time to turn around and take pictures as they ran towards me.
Also, I had to do it over hills.
Hills are hard.
:(
Next time, the staff photographer gets a bike.
:)
Some Animated Pictures
(to keep you interested before I throw more words at you)
So, one of the things that I did after taking all these pictures was to make some animated .
Because the people cry out for animated .
Sadly, in a fit of irony, I have no animated .
gif of Shalaco.
But here are a few (click on them to see the animation):
Early runners, doing what they do best.
A Late Night chase, stymied by little kids!
(Their guardians were distressed that the little ones had gotten in the way, but I assured them that it was fantastic.
)
The Early Journey
I had a great elaborate plan set up with Qarly--we'd originally planned for her to come speeding out of Howe to MacArthur, letting me get pics of her barreling in and scattering a mass of players.
After checking it out and deciding that we didn't want to drive players into heavy traffic and be responsible for the first serious injuries at a Journey, I set up on Piedmont, with her lurking behind a dumpster, ready to come out when people turned onto Piedmont from MacArthur.
But it turns out I don't have the best intuition for player decisions.
As I stood on the corner watching for players so I could alert Qarly, I could see them a few blocks away coming from the park along roadway, a huge mass of players (this was going to be great!
), streaming into the intersection.
and not turning, continuing on roadway, northeast, right past MacArthur.
I let Qarly know, and booked it into the hills to find the other chasers and hopefully get some pictures.
(As it later turns out, I just didn't have enough patience after the initial rush went along Broadway and I ran off, it turns out the next large mass of players came just as predicted.
Qarly, with her bike, was able to travel around and dive into huge groups of players.
Next time, players!
)
So off I went, into the hills (the hills, the cursed hills!
), and soon realized that the odds of me running across a chase while it was happening were actually pretty slim.
I wandered around, seeing just a few players, not quite sure where I should be.
At this start, I started to panic a little bit and wonder whether or not i would get any good pictures to justify my spending the whole game as a photographer.
I soon realized that if I wanted a chase, if I wanted to get pictures, I had to bring runners and chasers together.
So I contacted a few chasers and tried to get ahead of them, to be ready for where they were going to go.
I lucked out a couple of times with this strategy: I would actively look for players and chasers, figure out where they would meet up, and run to the \danger zone\' to set up pictures.'
After this happened once or twice, a few players noticed what was going on.
Even though I wasn't wearing an orange armband, they soon recognized that I meant danger.
After some players saw me a third time, they knew that this was a sign of trouble--and promptly turned around and went another way!
In fact, you can see here (if you click on the image) a runner who takes a moment to realize that there's a reason I'm taking pictures of him.
Sadly, it is not enough to save him.
I recognized that I was going to need to step it up.
So I started running around, looking for groups of players, getting past them, then calling one of the staff chasers with their location and direction, so I could just wait where I was and let the chaser drive them back towards me.
It felt like being a double agent, actually.
I was an informant for the chasers, an agent wandering the course.
The last time i did this, a couple of players eyed me warily as we passed, and looked back as I was on the phone.
When I saw them again, running past me in the other direction while I snapped pictures, I heard one say, \I knew when he went for his cell phone it was trouble!'
Rubin looked pretty scary.
And Lank.
Lank looked amazing.
Lank also performed in one of my favorite chases of the night.
He spotted a runner across the street, and called out, \I'll give you ten seconds!'
And a few seconds later, Lank bolts across the street in pursuit.
Terrifying, I tell you.
You can see the animation sequence if you click below.
But I also got some nice pictures of the many players-turned-chasers.
Some on the run:

Some posing:

And my favorite chase of the night was from player chasers, team Gravedigger:
The last picture is one of my favorites from the night long hair does a great job of showing motion and speed.
If you click below, you can see the chase animated:

The Tide Turns
I kept seeing more and more player chasers.
many more than had been expected, this early in the game.
I became another informant, then, for Dax--calling in the number of chasers I was seeing, and letting him know to rein in the staff chasers.
Especially given the density of chasers, it was nice to be invincible--walking around, involved with the game, but with my only responsibility to get where the action was.
Strangely enough--partly from this invincibility, partly from the running--I started to regain some of that feeling of confidence in my own movement, knowing that I could easily get across the street without getting hit and take pictures of the chase.
I eally did feel kind of invincible.
Fairly soon, I also realized that I had the same problem that chasers have after the first few checkpoints, the remaining runners are scattered along the route.
Trying to find them is kind of like trying to find a needle in a haystack and even though I was staff, I wasn't getting many updates on how far along the course the runners were (though most of that was because they were being blocked and caught by chasers).
As the players very rapidly thinned out, I started to be more on their side.
At the beginning, I had to stick with the chasers to find those interactions and chases (knowing that they would find runners).
Now, I had to find and follow runners, knowing that chasers would find them.
But I did try to help the players I ran into--a sort of conservationist streak, hoping that some of them would survive to the end.
I went ahead, not simply for shots, but also to scout out chasers and give advance warning.
As time progressed, though, the players dwindled and the dark took over.
Eventually, I started to play with the chasers I saw.
I knew how, as a chaser, your sense goes off when you see someone acting nervous or eying you.
This is especially true later in the game, when you're desperate to find prey.
So I started to walk like a runner, act like I was trying to ignore them and still move quickly.
or look at my map, or keep looking over my shoulder.
once I caught their attention, I'd start to move faster, so they'd start to move faster to keep up--and eventually they'd start running, so I'd take off running!
Then, when they've finally caught me, I'd turn to them and say, \Nope
 when you hear people running behind you
to see that you should be running, too.
The best thing for runners to do, of course, is run.
Sometimes, though, one suddenly turns back from chaser.
These are the first two resurrected chasers, who narrowly escaped from the challenges before them:
Interlude: Checkpoints
I didn't get to all the checkpoints during the night (I was preoccupied with trying to stay ahead of the players), but the four I saw were great.
I helped Bex and Yellowbear put together the Journey Tarot cards for the first checkpoint, and was pleased with how they turned out.
Did anyone notice the SF0 logos slipped onto The Fool and The Magician?
At the third checkpoint, I met Dax's mom.
The conversation went something like this.
who are you?
DM: I'm Dax's mom.
Me: Really!
That's amazing!
I love Dax!
DM: That's great!
Checkpoint four gave me another one of my favorite pictures.
Checkpoint six looked great, too everyone there looked good, but this picture of Herbie Hatman captured it best.
The End/Interviews
The end location was fantastic good people, all pumped from the Journey.
In particular, though, the projected map that Dax put up was amazing.
It was a great way for people to share their stories.
Also, Myrna looks great in the light of the map.
One other thing which I tried to do was record some stories from people at the end.
At the end of Journey, everyone is excited--everyone has a story to tell, a narrow escape or near-escape a thrilling chase a sudden realization that the city is not laid out the way you think it is.
I was pretty tired at the end (see my earlier note re: hills), but I did manage to get a few stories.
Oluwaseun arrives: While interviewing Lank about his experiences as a chaser, the first runner (Oluwaseun) finishes and everyone cheers.
WARNING: people cheer very loudly, and I kept the volume maxed to convey the experience.

Great fun!
Great Journey!
I suggest all future Journeys have designated staff photographer(s) and interviewer(s) if possible!
Thanks to everyone who made this happen!
Let me begin by extending my most gracious thanks to all who were involved in organizing a most successful Journey Ã?akland, 2009.
â??Twas a most unforgettable evening.
note: for me, this night can be described as nothing short of rush after rush of bittersweet emotions, so bear with me.

PREFACE:
Itâ??s hard to say exactly what I expected Journey Oakland to be, or what it exactly meant to me â?¦ but needless to say, weeks upon weeks in advance I was excited for it.
Essentially, it has always held great meaning to me.
After all, when I was green to the game, Journey Chicago 2008 was one of the first SFÃ? events kindly introduced to me.
To me, Journey events are synonymous with SFÃ?.
Not to mention Oakland is, and always has been, a homeland for me.
I was born here and both branches of my family have made their homes here for at least the past three generations â?? my childhood summers were equally spent in Chinatown and East Oakland with my grandparents and great-grandparents.
As an 'adult' with greater mobility and independence I have had no greater joy than to be able to fully appreciate and know Oakland in all its splendor.
PROLOGUE:
Leading up to the day, I spent many a moment spamming my friends on Facebook and Twitter with news of its coming.
If they were not already SFÃ? players, they were all either very excited or very confused (sometimes both) and wanted to know more, and I was glad to provide them with the necessary details (taking care not to give too much away).
PREPARATION:
The day of the event came â?? I could hardly contain myself.
I spent much of the morning in preparation â?? wishing I got more rest but knowing that I wouldnâ??t have been able to sleep longer because of my excited anticipation, printing out maps of AC Transit bus routes, going over my mental map of Oakland again and again in my head and taking note of all potential checkpoints, packing my bag to be as light as possible in addition to as well equipped as possible, etc.
Noontime rolls around and Iâ??m meeting up with JTony and Bryce at Fruitvale BART to commiserate.
We obtain some delicious taco truck and head to the grassy median under the tracks where I spread out my maps of wondrous Oakland and begin indicating to them all the various spots I thought might appear as checkpoints, and their relative relation and accessibility to each other.
They too are as eager to run Journey as I am â?? and we continue on in my trusty steed Velvet (1984 Volvo sedan, maroon) so I can better help them flesh out their own mental maps of Oakland ahead of time.
We drive all over â?? from Fruitvale down East 14th through Chinatown, past the Crucible and up Mandela Parkway, cutting through downtown and over to Grand Lake.
I park over near Lakeshore Drive, we grab some Colonial Donuts and camp out for a while by the lake, killing time and attempting to calm our nerves.
We catch the 6:11pm bus over to Broadway and West MacArthur â?? my heart beats a little out of my chest as we approach the amphitheater.
I burst into a smile upon seeing familiar SFÃ? faces, and humbly excited in meeting the other half of the organizers I hadnâ??t already had the pleasure to meet.
More and more of my friends arrive â?? we are very early so we get a little preview of whoâ??s chasing and whoâ??s checkpointing.
Closer to 7pm more and more people file and cluster into the space, more familiar faces emerge from the crowd â?? Iâ??m already having an amazing time in just seeing us all in the same space, sharing the same thrilling anticipation.
JÃ?URNEY:

v=3oO0Ltszozs
_
Dax volleys instructions via megaphone to what is now a mass of runners â?? we all receive our armbands and maps.
At this point we have formulated into a group: Myself, JB Monotony/Bryce, JTony, Praximity/Tyler, Tiny Dancer/Brittney, Anomaly/Steven/Stephen.
Kristina provides us with sage words and well wishes and sooner than we expect we are off!
_
We made it a point to travel far and away from the direct path, and were satisfied to spot no chasers (or even other players) taking our route.
Weâ??re all jumpy and nervous (me more so than others) and I find myself frantically pre-planning the best route from each checkpoint to the next.
Iâ??m starting to get borderline neuroticâ?¦ and frankly Iâ??m not having the most fun I could be having, but I am still exhilarated to finally be running Journey after all this time spent waiting for June 20th to come.
We approach the first checkpoint (our minor planning dramas explained above) and are wary but excited that we have yet to see a single chaser.
Of course, within a block of the safe zone, a chaser appears from his hiding spot behind a parked car.
We all bolt.
His eyes lock onto me and I run.
â??Shitâ?¦â? escapes from my lips.
I run down a driveway in hopes of discouraging him to follow someone running away from an open, obvious pursuit path.
Still he follows.
I dash through someoneâ??s garden, narrowly avoiding their tomatoes before hopping down an embankment into the neighborâ??s driveway.
Still he follows.
I run into the street and volley myself through the approximately ten inch gap between a parked minivan and sedan and turn uphill.
Itâ??s at this point I immediately regret partaking in 1) the very hilly North Berkeley bike ride I took with friends Thursday evening and 2) the 22 mile San Jose Bike Party ride that did not end until 2am Saturday morning.
Iâ??ve spent the last of my reserve energy that I hadnâ??t already depleted on my fixed-gear excursions.
I loose speed.
Ultimately, he has longer legs.
He catches me, out of breath and with a smile on his face and motions for my green ribbon.
The green ribbon I was so proud to wear, the green ribbon so nicely tied into a bow by my teammate, the green ribbon that has meant so very much to me in a so very impossibly short amount of time.
â??Hey, youâ??re fast!
â? he says, out of breath.
Itâ??s at this moment in time I am overcome with emotion.
We stand on the corner, the chaser and I, and as I remove my ribbon I cannot contain myself.
In anger I throw it at his hand and say â??fuck.
â? Then, I shout it.
As I rest my face in my hands tears and sobs shake my entire body as I make some attempt to process what just happened, and why I'm so upset about it.
He says, â??You know, the game is pretty fun from this angle too.
â? I appreciate his efforts â?? but his words are lost to me.
I make some attempt, in between weeping, why I am so upset at being caught.
I ask him if he plays SFÃ?.
â??No, but Iâ??m a friend of Sean, Ian and Sam from Chicago.
â? I tell him thatâ??s great, and ask how long heâ??s known about Journey.
â??Oh, a few months.
â? Monthsâ?¦ sure, Iâ??ve probably only known about Journeyâ??s existence for about twice thatâ?¦ but Iâ??m fairly sure he hasnâ??t been spending too much of his time shamelessly promoting and planning.
Itâ??s only a street game, after all.
I continue to cry â?? I think of my teammates and wonder of their fate â?? none of them know Oakland like I do (but clearly that didnâ??t help me) I had no idea whether or not they even made it to the checkpoint.
Donâ??t get me wrong, he was a very nice gentleman and made effort to calm me down (even though some of what he said didnâ??t necessarily help) and he encouraged me not to â??give upâ? (ouch) on the game and just try to play as a chaser for a while.
I thanked him for his compassion and apologized for the undesirable circumstance of our meeting, but assured him I could not continue with the game unless I was running it, as experiencing it at least once all the way through as a runner was all I really wanted from the night.
At this point I receive a few calls to my cell phone â?? my teammates asking if I am alright.
I have to pause and itâ??s probably the hardest words I can say that Iâ??ve been caught.
With their condolences I burst forth with new tears â?? I am thankful they have survived to the first checkpoint â?? a simple luxury I wasnâ??t even granted â?¦on my very first Journey.
I hadnâ??t even reached what was probably the simplest goal of the night.
Anomaly rounds the corner across the street, sees me, not knowing I have been caught shrugs at me and asks where the checkpoint isâ?¦ the chaser leaves me and sprints away for a minute, only to return empty handed.
Iâ??ve obviously tired him out â?? not a very intelligent move on his part, tiring himself out so soon in the night.
He wishes me well and I thank him, we part ways.
Dejected, not quite out of tears, I start crossing through the hills back to Lakeshore and my car.
As I cannot bear to become a chaser I decide to at least pay visit to each of the checkpoints and offer my moral support to my surviving friends passing through.
The walk is not long, but walking alone affords me time to contemplate my situation.
As I am submerged in thought, runners pass me by, turning their heads around corners and rushing through the evening along their chosen paths.
'It is then the first two of the Four Noble Truths pass through my mind:
1)	Life is Suffering.'
'2)	The Root of All Suffering Is Attachment.'
I consider how my very deep anticipation for running Journey all the way to the end has prevented me from even considering what would occur if I were to be caught, and that I am so upset because I was so adamant on completing Journey as a runner.
I also come to the conclusion that Chance simply was not on my side at all in that moment â?¦ and it proved to me, just that much more, that despite how much you yearn for something, despite how much you prepare for an event, there is always equal chance that it will go fantastically or end in disaster.
When Iâ??m within two blocks of my car, I spot Colin, one of the SF Tweed ride organizers (and its primary Twitter representative), now a chaser, walking up the opposite side of the street.
We greet each other, and he too is puzzled why I am not chasing.
Again, â??giving upâ? is mentioned, but my reply this time is more poignant â?? I reply, â??I just donâ??t have it in me to chase people like this, Iâ??ve been this way since I was a kid.
â? (or something to that extent) I myself donâ??t get this statement much at the time, and he shrugs and mentions how he doesnâ??t mind chasing, he is an ex-punk!
We reach my car, and I wish him a good rest of Journey.
In the car I come to grips with my situation and I am no longer terribly upset about my predicament.
I drive by the second checkpoint only after assessing that parking is difficult around there and I donâ??t see any of my teammates coming or going, so I travel onto the third checkpoint in hopes of finding parking and waiting long enough for my friends to arrive.
The third checkpoint is a welcome sight: Lowteck greets panting, newly arrived runners with offers of lemonade and a spin of a wheel to determine their digestible fate.
When he sees Iâ??m neither running nor chasing he encourages me to still pay visit to the checkpoints and I assure him of my plans to do so.
He also mentions that thereâ??s a way I can re-enter the gameâ?¦ but heâ??s not at liberty to divulge any more information.
I take this into consideration, but worry about how I havenâ??t obtained any signatures and the first checkpoint is most certainly closed by now.
I am then presented with two petitions, one veeerrryyy anti-broccoli and one appealing for the ceasing of violent actions on the part of the anti-broccoli protesters.
Reading over the two statements I mention to the other checkpoint guardian that this will be difficult to make an unbiased choice in terms of what to sign as I know the player who is very anti-broccoli (I look in Lowteckâ??s direction, he smiles in apprehension at my decision).
Ultimately, I choose the petition attempting to stop the violent actions of the anti-broccoli coalition (they were demanding the stoning of farmers!
Farmers just trying to make a living growing whatever will support their families!
) and attempt to click the ballpoint pen a few times before realizing that itâ??s an electric-shocking prank pen instead of just the nerve endings in my funny bone randomly overloading.
Lowteck, of course, shakes his head.
â??They deserve it, if theyâ??re going to grow broccoli!
â?

He informs me that Myrna and Lincoln are working the second checkpoint (which I skipped over) and I make to leave to pay them a visit.
However, at that moment Ian and Jackie emerge into the safe zone carrying red and orange umbrellas and wearing headlamps!
Theyâ??re playing the â??good-fairiesâ? featured in the DC Journey â?? traveling safe zones!
Suddenly it dawns on meâ?¦ I have, in my possession, a red umbrella AND a headlamp.
I immediately approach Ian and excitedly ask him if theyâ??re in need of any other â??umbrella people.
 Heâ??s unsure but thinks itâ??s a possibility, and kindly provides me with Daxâ??s phone number to ask him myself!
At this point my spirits are lifted anew, and as I dial Daxâ??s number I am flush with emotion at a potential return to the game â?? but this time as a benevolent figure!
Dax graciously declines my suggestion, wonders what the devil Iâ??m doing with a red umbrella on a perfectly clear day and makes a very serious point of demanding who tipped me off!
I swore that there was no breech in his planning security and he encouraged me to come join them at the finish line to wait with the other organizers.
I thanked him, but I was already set on visiting all the checkpoints first.
By that time I wasnâ??t sure if the second checkpoint was still open and didnâ??t want to risk parking far away and walking over only to find that it was closed.
So, I traveled on to the fourth checkpoint.
Arriving at the fourth checkpoint, I was admittedly disappointed that this was the Chinatown playground chosen (as I admire the one with the junker ship so much more!
) but was still thoroughly excited to find my friends Anna One and Magpie running an excellent checkpoint of mythological proportions!
youtube:http://www.
v=mu-WN7ENCh0
minotaur smoke break!
It is at this checkpoint I decided to lay in wait for my teammates, as just having gotten word they were arrived at the third checkpoint and making their way over presently.
As I waited I conversed with other players (runner and chaser alike) and learned how many people who were tagged as chasers merely went home and started drinking early â?? probably out of similar (but most likely a lesser degree of) disappointment, and I was glad I decided to stick around and make effort to see the rest of the checkpoints as well as welcome my friends through the more-than-halfway point of the game.
A little while later my friend Jeremiah actually enters the safe zone, and I am quite happy to see him as I just mentioned the game to him the other day and had no idea he would actually play!
He inquired as to why I was looking so doleful and I filled him in, and he very kindly says in so many words â??buck up, camper!
â?? at which I smile (or at least attempt to).
After he completes the checkpoint task Jeremiah informs me of the â??secretâ?? way to re-enter the game (as provided by one of the checkpoint guardians).
The phone booth symbol on the map near checkpoint six â?¦ I seriously consider this proposition for a moment but decide against depriving someone else (who most likely wants to run again more than myself) of the opportunity to be resurrected.
Soon after he leaves my teammates arrive, all extending open embraces and solace.
I fight back some tears and Iâ??m genuinely glad theyâ??ve made it safely.
They happily complete the checkpoint task and regroup to plan their course of action to checkpoint five.
Intermittedly they inform me of their adventures thus far â?? their extreme panic after I was caught, how JTony and Tiny were hiding in bushes nearby to where I was caught and witnessed my complete and utter distress (itâ??s at this point I definitely start crying again, Bryce offers me a hug), their reunion at checkpoint three and addition of another member, Ben Sunshine.
I tell them about my experience at checkpoint three, calling Dax, and the odd coincidence of having a red umbrella AND a headlamp handy on the night of Journey.
Currently Iâ??m feeling rather emotionally neutral or numb, and I can see how I appear really upset to everyone (frankly, itâ??s no lie, I was indeed deeply unsettled for both reasons of joy and of sorrow) and they encourage me to run along side them.
Itâ??s at this point Ben Sunshine mentions how heâ??s heard of many chasers laying in wait just beyond 880 (the freeway we need to cross under to reach the next safe zone, 2nd street).
An idea occurs to me and I say it â?? I offer myself up as scout to their party â?? Iâ??ll walk ahead of the group and warn them of any potential chaser activity.
Iâ??m feeling really good about this, Iâ??ve rejoined with my group, and even though Iâ??m not running with them I can still be a helpful force in their adventure.
We reach the safe zone for checkpoint five uneventfully â?? there were a few persons who I had to investigate up close (whether or not they wore orange arm bands) but no actual chasers were anywhere in sight.
Walking along with the group, basking in the glow of their revelry at making it this far soon however brought on pangs of sadness about how I could have been also included in their accomplishmentsâ?¦ if not for blind chance.
Ironic, of course, that I was the only one of my team to be caught â?? I was the only one out of all of them with vast knowledge of Oakland, the one who was most outwardly excited for the game weeks in advance, and I definitely am not lacking in physical agility.
We reach checkpoint five, complete the task and have good enough fortune to encounter YellowBear and Bex ready to leave as another mobile safezone with their giant red umbrella.
The rest of my team walks in good spirits with them to checkpoint six, and as I am temporarily uneeded I run off for a while in search of a restroom (drinking all that water in preparation for dehydration from running didnâ??t prove very useful).
We all end up at checkpoint six safe and sound, but unfortunately greeted by the sorry sight that the buildingâ??s security guards have kicked out our checkpoint!
Despite this, we have a jolly time meeting up with Minch, Kristina, Shalaco, some other Corpus Callosum members and Herbie Hatman as they administer the task to my teammates.
Minch and I exchange biiiiiig hugs, she very kindly complements my haircut (Vulcan!
) and as we seat ourselves in the rocking chairs by the roadside.
Bryce is nearby as she asks how our night as been and is puzzled as to why Iâ??m not wearing any armbands.
What comes out of my mouth next is characteristic of the odd clarity of thought that has come over me â?? I tell her about how I was caught and how I felt completely unable to perform as a chaser as â??I just donâ??t have it in me to take things away from people.
â? Bryce looks at me and after a pause says, â??I think thatâ??s the nicest thing Iâ??ve ever heard.
â? And in a way, heâ??s hit the nail on the head â?? it strikes me that my fundamental nature as a really, really (oftentimes ridiculously) Nice person has actually prevented me from participating in this game to my fullest.
Donâ??t get me wrong, Iâ??m sincerely flattered and humbled by what he said, I try very hard every day to â??be the change I want to see,â?? to be the most gracious, accommodating, and sincere individual as much as humanly possible.
But, at the end of the day, it's just the nature of the world we live in that being nice sometimes isn't enough.
I was clearly distraught over not being able to run Journey anymore and it really just brought tears to my eyes even thinking about ever making someone else feel the way I was feeling at that moment.
(Of course, I realize exactly why I was so miserable, and that I take all the credit for.
I was in extreme denial of ever being caught over the course of this game and I suppose in a rather harsh way I received my just deserts for being so attached.
)
Iâ??m really not looking for pity here, and I wasnâ??t at the time either â?? I was (understandably) caught up in my own misery and I tried my hardest not to impress that upon other people, but frankly I am TERRIBLE at disguising my emotional states.
Everyone gets through telling their jokes (with varying degrees of success) to Herbie and we bolster ourselves for the last and final leg of our good long run.
Shalaco, now retired from his bicycle-chaser duties turns out to be a very helpful scout for farther-reaching distances while I carry on my job scouting about one-half to one block ahead of the group.
Because of the time, location, and warnings of multitudes of chasers lurking along the lake we decide to camp out in the 12th Street BART station until the 51 Bus comes to take us to West Grand, where we can cut over to the edge of the final safe zone.
But despite it not being terribly late (around 12:15am), I receive a text from Shalaco that the final checkpoint has been shut down by the police and that we better get there quick (and not to worry about chasers, as theyâ??ve all left).
At this point we are already on the bus, so we resolve to take the most direct route and have me scout ahead just in case there are any more chasers around just for the sake of chasing and stealing ribbons.
Weâ??re also still set on edge by another text I just received from my friend Jeremiah who had the misfortune of being caught mere feet from the safe zone.
As we approach 20th street Bryce and JTony become worried about the time and catching BART home â?? and after hearing that the final checkpoint is near-closed they take their leave for 19th Street Station as we carry on in their honor.
Once we leave the bus I scout ahead, checking to see that none of the people departing the safe zone appear interested in catching additional runners, and wave to my teammates itâ??s a clear shot to the safe zone.
We round Fairyland and in seeing more people leaving we make a dash for the Gazebo and make it, by the skin of our teeth, to the finish line where Dax signs in my teammates and awards them their buttons.
They hoot and holler, collapse from exhaustion and joy and I watch with a timid smile on my face (probably not too visible in the darkness).
Jeremiah comes over and I empathize with him also being caught, in many ways the situation of his capture was just as agonizing as mine â?? I didnâ??t even make it to the first checkpoint but he ran the whole game safely only to be trapped so near the final checkpoint.
I make a point to show Dax my red umbrella and head lamp and he offers a laugh, which is all Iâ??m really looking for, and he and Rubin continue to pack up camp.
EPILOGUE:
My teammates express their great thanks to me for helping them through the latter half of the game, express their sorrow at my being caught and for these gestures I am deeply thankful.
As I see it, I did not achieve my original goal of running my first Journey in its entirety, but I did fulfill my ambitions of helping my friends at whatever cost â?? and for this reason I am happy with the night.
We all part ways, hugs are exchanged and Tiny plants an amazing kiss of gratitude on my cheek â?? Jeremiah, Tyler and I resolve to get some celebratory drinks at the Ruby Room.
Itâ??s just the same as usual (with the exception of one bartender lighting the bar on fire â?? purposefully) but all of us are waaaayyy too exhausted to dance to the selection of fine tunes the DJ is spinning.
So we sit, we drink, and conclude our night on a happy (though weary) note.

ENDING THOUGHTS:
Reading through the other praxis of the night, I admire the fact that not all the other people who â??gave upâ? just went home or out drinking and made effort to visit the other checkpoints, and that those who became chasers were also faced with the same disheartening feelings at their newfound duties.
I salute you, if only for proving I am not alone in my particular sentiments.
â??What made my decision, though, was that despite the orange band around my arm, I still identified with the runners.
I didn't want to inflict that same sinking feeling that I now felt upon other people aspiring to make it to the end.
â? â?? Future 
 â??This was the moment that changed - nothing.
I didn't even really feel like catching any of the friendly runners.
I did, however, feel like seeing the other checkpoints.
All of them.
â? â?? Ugly Igloo 
p.
- keep an eye out for my teammates' praxis!
i would have submitted with them, but i didn't want to steal the thunder of their success!
And a great bow to everyone else:
Checkpoint Guardians and Umbrella-toters, I salute you.
Accomplished Chasers, I salute you.
Accomplished Runners, I salute you.
Again, Thank You Journey facilitators for hosting such an incredible event!
Youâ??ve brought joy and fun to so many people â??what else does one need from life?
I joined up with LarS and David at the Geary bus stop on the corner of Leavenworth around 9PM.
We headed down Geary towards Checkpoint #3.
Right across from us on the bus were the agents from Checkpoint #1, which was Ian's parents.
They were dressed in fancy attire which confused me at first but i myself was wearing my fuzzy kitty leg warmers and a long kitty tail.
LarS had a map with approximate locations of checkpoints.
At each checkpoint you receive a signature and clue of who you need to look for at the next checkpoint.
We started late, so to stay on top of the game, we had skipped Checkpoint #2 which made us a little unsure of where we needed to go.
Soon two more SF Zero(future winners of the task) folks boarded the bus.
YOu can tell they were in the game with their child like smiles and ribbons that were tied on to their arms.
AT the next stop several more SF Zero taskers boarded.
We followed their leads and was led right to Checkpoint #3 which was a pool hall on Geary.
We were told that at the next checkpoint to look for a person holding a broom.
We never made it to that checkpoint!
Another twist to the task was \The Chasers.'
This led to alot of running around.
There were chasers on foot, bikes and even those gas powered tourist rent a buggies.
(or whatever they are called?
) We eventually were caught in Golden Gate park and switched to a \Chaser\' ribbon.'
It was getting late and we decided to head to Ocean Beach for the beach bonfire where everyone was to meet up after the task.
This was actually very exciting for me being my first ever beach bonfire!
I was overwhelmed when i stepped onto the beach and saw roughly 20 - 30 different bonfires!
It was a Beautiful clear night with many a stars in the sky.
A super fun evening!
Thanks SF Zero.
(big smiles)
Grrrr.
I left after the cops came by and everyone was packing up!
wish i would of stuck it out!
I've been wanting to run my own journey ever since San Francisco's brought me into SF0.
It was my introduction to SF0, and what a great introduction it was.
A night of terror, adventure, and exhilaration.
It was such a thrill--I wanted to share that.
Thus began my DC journey.
Beginnings
 While the idea had been percolating for several months, the first real discussion came at a DC0 event when rongo rongo came to visit.
A perfect time to involve FZ!
and Eccoglyph in my nefarious plots.
So we sketched out tentative places to put on the map, some good DC landmarks.
In the process, we considered a number of places to finally end up at.
I'd considered the Smithsonian grounds or other Park Police-maintained public grounds, but it seemed like a great idea to have a big house party.
Somewhere nice and warm, a welcoming end to what would hopefully be a harrowing night.
While there were still many other things to be done, we needed to set a date, so that recruitment and advertising could begin.
And to do that, we needed a place to host the End of the Journey.
Enter Brandon.
Brandon volunteered his place to host the conclusion.
As it turned out, he would do much more than that.
A freelance web developer by trade (hire him!
), he also put together the design for the Journey website.
His excitement and enthusiasm were a great help throughout the journey, from coming along to plan the route, advertising and organizing, he was a great partner in the endeavor.
Let me throw out a reference for him: JOURNEYDC08RUN1
Dax's Journey and The Offer I Could Not Refuse
I still had to figure out a date, finalize the route, recruit some more people, and do the myriad little things which go into planning a Journey.
As with many great things, you make up most of it.
And the rest.
well, you get some good people to help you.
I had Brandon, I had Eccoglyph and FZ!
And once she heard about it, nano5th was totally in.
I had several other local friends I could convince to join this crazy scheme, too.
But things were still uncertain and only slowly becoming clear.
then something happened to throw the whole thing into fast-forward: Journey Chicago.
Dax certainly seemed to have been planning it for a while: the Journey announcement showed up with SF0 founder support, a beautiful painted poster ad, and a website.
I was impressed.
More than that--I was worried, and I was a little bit jealous.
I was still thinking about having it that same night, but was also considering weekends nearby.
So I sent Dax a note to try to either coordinate some inter-city Journeying, or see when things might happen.
What I did not expect was this reply:
I would be down for coming to DC to help you with yours, if you'd consider coming to ChicagÃ¸ to give me a hand with mine.
It was an offer I could not refuse.
In the meantime, we walked the route and took some good shots to use as promo material.
Because publicity was going to be important.
Ah, publicity.
It helped that we had a great website.
Once that was up, we started to put the word out.
We got a few blog references, put up a facebook event, and sent out quite a number of emails.
Word of mouth started to spread.
We had no idea if this was going to work.
We didn't really have a big base of DC0 players, and most of our people had already been enlisted as lead runners or checkpoint agents.
We had to use this as a way of getting new DC0 people, rather than relying on existing ones.
Who knew how many people might come?
So we had to spread word like crazy.
Especially since the weather was threatening to come down on us.
Prepwork
 The Weather.
Oh, the weather.
From the moment they started to make predictions, I was obsessively checking.
Ten days before May 3rd, it told me that there would be rain.
With nine days to go, that had increased to thunderstorms.
At eight days, it went to partly cloudy.
Seven, back to rain.
And six, thunderstorms again.
Clearly, the weather way toying with me.
I knew that weather was something which could ruin this.
The heavens could open up, and no one would come, and there would be nothing I could do about it.
Well, almost nothing.
So I contacted my friends at NOAA--they said they'd see what they could do, but wouldn't make any promises.
Just in case, I decided that I should get ponchos.
So that I could hand them out at the start--maybe this would encourage some people to face the rain, and at least we could have a small Journey.
Trying to control the weather was clearly crazy.
Then again, mass-ordering ponchos.
that would be a little bit crazy too, wouldn't it?
Crazy to the tune of 96 ponchos, to be exact.
Let me just say: the internet is an amazing place, and sacrifices must sometimes be made to the weather gods.
In any case, there was still a huge Journey to plan.
Twelve hundred feet of ribbon!
Three hundred maps!
Contact information and directions for twenty-one organizers!
Six amazing checkpoints, including transportation logistics and refreshments!
Eight starting chasers, each with meticulously planned instructions to maximize area coverage and player terror!
Prizes of all sorts!
Brandon made our beautifully crafted map, after checkpoints and safe zones were finalized:

 And the texting system.
A lot of planning went into each part of the Journey, but the texting system was the centerpiece.
A masterwork of modern technology, it was set up to be a text message remailer--anyone could send a text message in to the central dispatch, and that would be instantly forwarded to all chasers and checkpoint agents.
Each checkpoint would text when the 1st, 10th, and 50th players arrived--this way, the chasers would know where the lead players and masses of players were at all times.
The chasers would text when they caught someone, and when they moved locations, allowing everyone to know what zones were being covered and where chaser were being created.
It was beautiful a texting system which would provide amazing situational awareness over the course a texting system which would provide unparalleled quantitative data from the Journey.
The Journey!
a texting system which completely failed us.
Let me explain.
An hour before the Journey's scheduled time, Brandon, Dax, and I drove down to Dupont circle.
We pulled up to a prime parking spot.
and it turned out the car in front of us had a fleur de lis!
Clearly, this was an auspicious sign.
As it turned out, the weather held off.
And our publicity campaign had succeeded better than I had expected.
Hundreds of people showed up at Dupont circle over the next hour.
There was a line stretching halfway around the circle.
I was scrambling to try to get everyone signed in before 7:30, when I had hoped to let everyone loose.
As more and more people came, I tried to get more and more signup sheets around the table.
Fortunately, I had made sure to be prepared for up to 300 people, having extra ribbon, pens, maps, and signup sheets.
We started giving out maps and ribbons rather than having everyone sign up.
As it turned out, this extra preparation was crucial even with it, I felt panicked and almost overwhelmed.
239 people!
People seemed pretty excited.
I was feeling good, if a little pressed for time.
At last, the line seemed to be done with--and it was time for me to start.
I went up to the Dupont fountain, and started up with the megaphone.
I gave everyone the rules, I made some jokes, I took some questions.
and then I let everyone go.
And they went.
I wish I'd been better prepared with the camera, because it was an amazing sight to see hundreds of people streaming out of Dupont, headed south and west, scrambling along as fast as they could.
I had a huge grin--not only because of the amazing sight, but also because I'd finally managed to get everyone off.
Only a few minutes late.
Checking the time, I.
Ten minutes early?
Well, that's okay, that's fine.
No need to worry.
I needed to send out the initial text message: 'They're off!
The main groups seem to be heading down P and New Hampshire.
Go Chasers!
'  I sent it, and prepared to head to the end (to coordinate as needed and be ready for the first finishers).
Then I got a text from one of my chasers, roughly along the lines of 'Z0MG!
Players are already here!
Did you let them go already?
'   No texts were coming through the central texting system.
This was the point at which, as with any Journey, things went completely out of control.
I'd accidentally let a throng of two hundred and fifty players loose through the streets of DC, ahead of schedule, with my chasers not yet alerted.
Frantically calling and texting the chasers and checkpointers, we could only hope that everything would somehow work out well.
It was a crazy scramble packing up, notifying, trying to do damage control on The Plan, and make it over to the final checkpoint.
But when we made it there, everything would certainly be all right--the online tool would let us check the texts coming in and then just trigger it to resend them to everyone, right?
Sadly not: even the online system was dropping texts, and would only send to five people at a time.
So, as it had been fated, the power and chaos of the Night overtook my carefully laid plans.
I could only trust that I had chosen my agents well.
Fortunately, I had.
Despite the chaos of the Night, or perhaps because of it, everything turned out fantastic.
The players were well chased, and found many wonderfully populated checkpoints.
Those who became chasers and those who escaped unscathed both had an excellent night.
This is one more thank you to everyone who helped make this an amazing journey.
Telling Tales
It turns out we have some real runners in DC.
I kept getting reports from my checkpoint agents that the first runners had reached their station.
Some of this was my fault for letting them go early, but it quickly became clear that something unexpected was happening--people were getting through the checkpoints much faster than we'd anticipated.
And outpacing chasers, too.
I got reports from lead chasers that there were some fast players out there.
Pretty son, I had a chance to meet them myself--at 8:37, just eighty minutes after I had released everyone from Dupont circle, came not one, but two swift runners!
Team Patrick^2.
literally one minute later, they were joined by Marc Harkness (who had actually been in the lead for most of the course, as confirmed by the checkpoint agents--he was overtaken with only four blocks to go by Patrick^2, whom he reports 'were coming at me so fast that they glowed red with the Doppler effect').
Â  Soon Peter Weiss arrived as a very close fourth, at 8:46!
These four runners had not merely run a block, walked a block.
they had run the entire course.
Their strategy for avoiding chasers?
Run faster.
And it worked, though they each had been chased (and with dedication, too--team Patrick^2 said they really had to pour it on, and keep it on to get away).
The next group to arrive was at 9:16, a group of swift runners who had been caught and turned into chasers--the next survivors would not make it for another hour.
A Journey to the End of the Night:DC t-shirt and three chalices were thus awarded!
The first 25 players to complete the course, and the first 10 chasers with at least one capture all received wonderful badges (thank you, Dax!
The top chaser prize (another Journey shirt) went to Jonathan Roberts, for capturing no fewer than 11 players over the course of the night!
As the night went on, checkpoint agents and players continued to trickle in.
Shortly after midnight, I gathered everyone to tell stories and give out additional prizes.
We gave out some bonus prizes as well:
 
Worst injury
We received reports of a broken leg (slightly exaggerated, though they did end up in the hospital in a wheelchair), but the worst injury prize went to someone who leapt over a metal fence and poked a hole in their arm, but were graciously given first aid by their chaser (Dax) and a nearby pre-med.
Best costuming
 To the team at checkpoint two, for obvious reasons.
I'll let them tell you why their theme was so fantastic, but it actually goes beyond good costuming.
With glowing test tubes and a fully-constructed Doc Brown thinking hat from Back to the Future, this prize was an easy choice.
Best story
As with many things about Chicago's Journey, I liked Dax's 'ten words or less' storytelling challenge, and so stole it on behalf of DC.
There were a number of good entries, but it was clear that the best entry went something like this: 'Stopped and handcuffed by police, white powder in my bag.
'
 It turns out that this weekend was an 'All Hands on Deck' night--with plenty of extra police patrolling.
So it was only to be expected that someone would be seen running and stopped as suspicious.
In this case, the police officer quickly cuffed the player's arms behind his back and proceeded to examine his backpack (something, the player helpfully pointed out, which would have been easier without the cuffs).
Upon opening it, what should they see but a bag coated with white powder.
Upon going to taste it, the player exclaimed, 'You don't want to do that--there's fiberglass in there!
'  It turns out that he was a rock climber, and that a chalk bag had come loose in his backpack.
After a taste confirmed it (the carabiners he had on him supported his story as well), the cop realized they should let him go.
I like the conclusion to this story, too: the chaser had not given up after the player was stopped by the police officer, instead lurking down the block (either a jerk move or cold-blooded chaser dedication, depending on how you look at it).
Knowing this, our hero told the police officer, while being uncuffed, that he didn't want to seem suspicious or get taken down again, but as soon as the cuffs were off, he was going to take off running to get away from the chaser.
He did, and survived to make it to the end.
The Endurance prize was the last one given out--given to our last three finishers, who made it in just after we had given out the story prize and were about to call it a night.
There were a number of other amazing stories from the night I'll tell, in brief, just three more, and invite their owners to expand upon them as they see fit:
1.
When you're on the metro train, you can see chasers in the next car, and they can see you.
what do you do?
One person escaped by faking them out, getting off a stop early, giving no indication until he slipped out the door at the very last minute, leaving the chasers trapped behind on the train.
This same person also discovered the 'Secret Warp Zone'.
By taking a metro train near checkpoint six, they safely traveled further East, past checkpoint 7.
ending up already in the safe zone, then backtracked entirely in safety.
One person hid in a porta-potty for half an hour to escape a chaser.
I don't really want to imagine what that was like.
With a chaser in hot pursuit, two players ran, then ducked into a building to hide.
The danger was over, and the chaser passed.
Rather, I should say, the danger from the chaser had passed.
For the building they had run to and ducked in was none other than the FBI building, a fact they realized only after two agents ran out, shouting at them to freeze, with guns out and pointed at them.
They ended up spending an hour or two chatting with the FBI--but in the end, survived and made it to the final checkpoint!
A Few Final Numbers
If you're like me, you like numbers.
So here are a few for you.
37 teams signed up.
Some of my favorites were '10 is 2', 'Flying Camels', and 'Spoon!
'He hate me' was the runaway favorite, with 29 members.
239 players signed up for the beginning.
Surviving players made it to checkpoints in (approximately) the following numbers:
 1: 196
2: 189
3: 137
4: 121
5: 85
6: 68
7 (end): 68
Here is a link to the google map route, including mileage (without metro assistance).
If I get time, I'll try to get some time and mileage details, with plots of player progression from the night, maybe even an animation.
but for now, I'm going to leave this already-long proof.
In the end, I was very happy with the DC Journey.
I felt like I had given people a great night, and had given back some of what I had received from the San Francisco Journey.
It's a wonderful experience, and I was very happy to share it.
All honors to Spidere for hosting Journey in DC.
This was the largest attendance for any SFÃ? game in the States, run in the nation's capital during a police high-alert, right in front of the White House.
His game caused two arrests, a semi-broken leg, and countless sprained ankles.
Spidere also single-handedly quelled the impending rain with some ritual involving internet ponchos.
He also put me up in his very own bed, and fed me various deliciousnesses.
I didn't go.
Temporary points.
Running along Lunt Avenue, 9pm, less than 24 hours into my 21st year of life, three Stella bottle caps dancing and clanging together in my left jeans pocket, I have never felt this way before.
Trying much harder than the last time to evade the guy on the bicycle, I turn down an alleyway and cut through the yard of the gray house at the end of the block, heading one block north to run on a less desirable route where I should be less noticeable.
Heartland Cafe is less than three blocks away, and I can't help but think to myself \how did I come to this?'
Months earlier I had envisioned being taken out by my fraternity brothers and having shots thrown at me left and right.
It wasn't a bad image, but it was so cliche it made me want to shoot myself in the foot.
When I got the message about JTTEOTN, I was ecstatic.
I missed last years Journey, because of finals no less, and was very disappointed.
It wasn't until about two weeks prior that I realized it was on the night of my 21st, and I am pretty sure I woke up half of my house because of how loud I screamed from excitement.
This was basically the best birthday present I could have ever asked for.
When I arrived at Welles park after having met my team at the CTA, I was amazed at the sheer number of people there.
A friend and I were literally jumping up and down with excitement, but we later calmed down to discuss strategy and what our route would be.
Once we were all checked in and ready to go, and after a false start during the middle of announcements, we were off.
We stayed together for about 3 blocks before I told my team that I had too much energy to take it slow and mess around, that I just needed my time to run around like an insane person on my birthday, and I broke off from the group.
I decided to send them periodic updates from further along the course, some of which would be helpful, but most of them not.
It felt great just to run and not really care about anything.
Randomly seeing other runners up ahead or running on a cross street blocks in front of me was really bizarre.
Just seeing one person every now and again with an armband on made me laugh at how random of a group we were, but also made me happy to be a part of something so large.
The first checkpoint was fascinating.
I chose to go the route of 1A and 2A, because 2B was on the lake and being anywhere near Lakeshore Drive seemed like it could have gotten difficult.
1A was in a large park near a high school I had never heard of.
I spotted a large area in the park cordoned off by caution tape, and I approached slowly, not really knowing what to expect.
My face was scanned by a man in a white biohazard suit, who told me I was a 'gamma' and directed me to another man in a biohazard suit who was standing deep within the maze of caution tape.
Once I made it over, under, and through the obstacle course, the man stamped my map and I was on my way.
Between checkpoints 1 and 2 it began to get darker.
The twilight added another dimension entirely to this already overwhelming night.
Being alone in a relatively unfamiliar neighborhood as the day was dimming would normally have been enough for me, but add to that being chased around by strangers, my map being soaked with sweat, and my jeans being way to tight to run comfortably in, and I was more than a little bit freaking out.
I am positive I looked like a crazy person to anyone along the streets I chose to run, as I was running in jeans and a hoodie on a warm night, obsessively checking my map at every street light, and constantly looking over my shoulder and sneaking around corners to see if anyone was following me.
Soon, even through my freaking out process, I arrived at checkpoint 2A.
A small folding table was set up on the sidewalk near the entrance to Rosehill Cemetery at the far northwestern corner of the safe zone.
A group of 8-10 people stood nearby in a huddle, whispering to one another, and behind them was a bulletin board with notes attached to it.
On the table was a pile of papers, some pens, a bell, and a sign that said \RING BELL FOR SERVICE.'
They informed me that this was the \last post office\' and I could write a letter to anyone and if it was addressed properly
I wrote my letter to my teammates, telling them good luck and Godspeed.
But my postage was denied, and my letter was burned by the group.
\CANCELLED\' was written on my map for checkpoint 2
Jogging along Rosehill, still in the safe zone, I spotted a chaser who was looking intently at me.
As I passed, she told me I was safe, but not for long, and as I walked away, I could hear her on the phone with a friend saying that I was coming their way.
Terrified, I ducked into an alleyway and winded my way northeast until I was just across from Senn High, one of the bonus checkpoints.
I had originally planned on skipping the bonus checkpoints, as I had heard speculation that they may be traps, but I really wanted to stop by Senn anyway because the building is really sweet, and I am an architecture student.
My decision turned out to be the right one, despite another group trying to trick me into believing that it was a trap.
I wandered around the massive high school, and heard a tiny dog barking at something.
I decided to head that way, as it meant that something was amiss, and when I rounded the corner into the large courtyard out in front of the school, to my right, on a tiny porch behind a column, was the bonus checkpoint.
I arrived early apparently, as their contraption was still being tested, and I was the first to get to use it.
I dropped a silver sparkly disc thing down a pegboard and it landed in a space marked with a green question mark.
I was handed a card that allowed me an extra life if a chaser were to catch me, and I started to walk off, pleased.
They told me to wait, however, as I was also allowed to choose one checkpoint to skip.
I chose number 3 because it was very far out of the way, and it was also near the lake, in an area where the red line tracks would create bottlenecks and chasers could easily catch me.
Pleased with my strategy, and with checkpoint 3 out of the way, I headed north to checkpoint 4.
Cutting through yards and alleys, I once again have the thought that everyone living nearby must think I'm insane.
I am significantly more pleased with my insanity now, however, as I have saved myself a considerable amount of time by skipping checkpoint 3.
I have ceased communication with my teammates as they have turned their phones off to conserve battery.
I am alone now.
Approaching checkpoint 4, I checked my map.
According to the map, the checkpoint should have been directly north of me in the park, but I couldn't see anything.
I moved a slight bit closer, and could see some people gathered in one of the picnic areas, but I still couldn't make them out very well.
Being in a strange neighborhood and not knowing much about the area, I approached cautiously.
I didn't want to walk into the middle of a drug deal or something.
Inching in through some bushes, I saw someone ride up on a bike wearing a helmet and carrying a foam sword.
obviously these were the people I was looking for.
When I made it over to the picnic area, I saw five or six people holding large puppets that were shaped like house elves from Harry Potter.
They informed me I was the first to the 4th checkpoint, to which I had no response other than to smile gleefully and hand them my map.
The map was stamped by the foot of the house elf, and westward I voyaged.
I decided to head toward Western and catch a bus up to the next checkpoint.
Maybe a block west of the park, I heard a bike behind me, and turned around to see who it was.
It was one of the chasers I had seen before, and since I was still in the safe zone, I turned and waved.
He looked confused, and rode up to tag me.
I told him I was still in the safe zone, and he looked around confused before realizing I was correct.
As he rode off, he informed me that he would be watching me since I was in the lead.
When I made it over to Western, I texted the bus tracker number for the Western northbound bus and it told me two minutes.
Ok, not too bad, so I jogged up to the next bus stop to avoid being stationary for too long, and the bus was still not there.
Frustrated, I went up to the next stop, and then the next, all the while becoming more and more paranoid that I would be caught because I was running in a straight line next to a giant open grass park.
Nevertheless, the bus came and I boarded it without being caught.
When I exited the bus at Lunt, I saw a large group of runners crossing the street toward the checkpoint.
I ran after them because I thought I recognized them, but when I caught up to them at the checkpoint, I realized that my eyes are worse than I thought, and I had no idea who these people were.
\The end is near\' at checkpoint 5
One of them approached me and took my map from my hand, almost as if in slow motion.
I was even more terrified than I had been at the last post office.
She turned me around and used my back to stamp my map, then told me to live well because there wasn't much time left.
\Wise words
It was an easy run west to the Heartland, or so I thought, straight across Lunt.
The Lunt bus wasn't running, since it was a weekend, so the last mile or so would be done on foot.
I made it mere blocks before I was spotted by the chaser on the bike I had encountered before.
He came after me and I ran into a driveway and hid behind a garage.
The sound of his bike echoed through the alley and around the houses, until it stopped and I could hear voices.
Someone from the neighborhood had stopped to ask him why everyone was running around her street like idiots, and he politely and concisely explained the game to her.
I used the opportunity to get away, and broke for freedom.
I wove up and down a few blocks the rest of the way west, and had to push myself to keep running.
The beers I'd had at my birthday dinner were beginning to reach my bladder, but I only used that as extra motivation to make it to the finish line.
As I rounded the corner on to Lunt, I could see Heartland Cafe in the distance.
It shone like a beacon of hope, relief, and beefy gluten-free-bun burgery goodness.
The last block seemed to pass by in slow motion, even while being cheered on by random passers by.
All of a sudden, I was inside.
My bewildered look must have tipped off the shop clerk to the fact that I was there for Journey, and he calmly directed me to the next room where I checked in, received my time and my merit patch, and grabbed some much needed hydration.
My final result was 4th place, out of 749 runners who started from Welles Park.
I had a total time of 1 hour 34 minutes and 15 seconds.
According to Google Earth, my total distance traveled was 7.
4 miles, 6.
9 of which was on foot.
After I came to grips with the fact that I did in fact finish 4th, I helped put up signs to direct the rest of the finishers inside.
I stood around various places inside and outside, trying to breathe normally again, talking to and greeting people as they came to check in.
I sat out on the bleachers for a good while and talked to a couple of volunteers from checkpoint 1B, whose theme had been \what do you want to do before you die?'
It made me seriously consider volunteering instead of running next year.
After a good while, some friends of mine showed up to check in.
Unfortunately, they hadn't made it alive, but one of them did get a kill, so he received a patch for that.
He was very excited about it, and immediately started thinking about where he was going to display it.
We went inside and had dinner to celebrate my birthday again, and also to celebrate my epic win of 4th place.
Let me just reiterate that this was the best birthday I have ever had or will ever have.
If you read this whole thing, you get major cool points.
Being my first time, I had no idea what I was getting myself into by agreeing to participate in Journey to the End of the Night.
I am a suburban mother of three who just wanted to have a fun time with my brother and friend.
It was so much more than that.
It is almost indescribable how much fun we had from the start to the finish.
At the beginning, we thought slow and steady was the way to go.
When everyone started running at the start, we were looking at our maps and planning our route.
Then the chaser on the bike with the raquetball raquet came after us.
We all ran in different directions and amazingly, all three of us managed to survive the chase.
I thought it was so funny I almost peed in my pants.
I think we were very lucky to not have gotten caught at the very start of the game.
That would have really sucked.
We walked a few blocks and took the el to a few blocks away from checkpoint one.
We were so paranoid of getting caught, got off a couple of stops away from the closest stop to the checkpoint.
We walked nervously through the side streets until we found a hotel and coffee shop we could walk through.
We ended up a block away from checkpiont 1.
We watched out the windows until we certain we could make it to the safe zone without getting caught.
Once we saw the coast was clear, we ran to the statues and found the amazingly nice woman on stilts.
We had a random person who was at the statues take our picture with her and planned our route to the next checkpoint.
(My friend Roger took all the pictures, I am hoping he will upload them as we have pictures at every checkpoint and with many people who helped us along the way).
We went back through the hotel and walked in a really zig zag fashion until we found a very helpful woman who took us through her apartment building's dog walking area through a magic door that led us across the street from the Target at the corner of Roosevelt and Clark.
She took a little convincing that we were playing a game, but once she realized we telling her the truth she was really helpful.
She saved us quite some time as we would never have found the magic door without her.
We walked through Target and exited right into the safe zone on the bridge.
The \teachers\' at the checkpoint were so funny.'
They asked us questions before giving us a sticker to mark our map.
Our questions were easy - what's 3+9 and A+B=?
the group that arrived after us was asked A+C=?
their answer was air conditioning and was told that was correct.
Then they were asked what color is the American Flag - they said purple and was told correct.
That made us laugh.
:-) 
From there, we got on a bus on Roosevelt.
Two others from the game got on after us.
We were all chatting and trying to decide where to get off.
We started to get of at Halsted with the two women in front of us.
They got tagged immediately upon stepping off the bus.
We didn't get off the bus.
We felt so bad they got tagged.
The chasers came out of nowhere to get them.
We stayed on the bus for several more stops - I think we got off at Blue Island or something like that.
By then we were off the map.
We made friends with a very nice guy who walked with us for almost a mile and helped to make sure we were going the right way.
We weaved our way for what seemed forever until we made it safely to checkpoint #3.
The superman/wasp was very funny and nice.
Lucky for us, right before making it to checkpoint 3, we got through to DC and got the info on the secret bonus checkpoint.
We made it there and loved to find out we were able to bypass one of the other checkpoints - we picked to not go to checkpoint 4, which turns out was the best decision we made all night.
We rode a bus for a few blocks with a group of 4 who were doing the same thing we were.
We were more paranoid than they were, so we followed about a block behind them most of the way to checkpoint 5, which was pretty heavily guarded when we got there, but we lucky to have made it to the safe zone just in time.
We met the spring chicken and the egg there.
They were really nice and helpful.
There were lots of chasers coming in and away from there, so we spent a little longer there than probably necessary, but we made it that far, we didn't want to lose from there.
We ran away from there and zig zagged through so many streets and alleys to get to checkpoint 6.
By this point, we were definitely slower in our pace as our legs were starting to hurt from all the walking and running we had been doing.
Luckily, we found an alley that ran parrallel to the safe zone and once we felt we could make it, we cut through an empty lot into the safe zone.
We thrilled to arrive safely and to such a warm reception.
We were #37 to arrive safely.
We loved to see others that we had seen along the way to have made it as well.
This was a wonderful experience.
Everyone was really nice, even the chasers that we met.
I'm so glad we did this and am really looking forward to doing it again next year and bringing more friends to participate as well.
Thank you for such a wonderful night!
I ran to the top of the coit tower from the ferry building!
and from that point on i pretty much jogged a block walked a block jogged a block walked a block my way to the end of the night.
i got crazy lost in the woods towards the end.
but aside from this didnt really have much hardship.
wasnt really ever chased so hard.
i feel i was just about 5 minutes away from the pursuers at all times.
i'm guessing this, as edward, who finished second, said hed been chased like 5 times, and he finished only 5 minutes after me, and he'd pretty much been 5 mins behind the whole time, we exchanged solemn exhausted nods a couple of times as i'd leave a check point and he'd be arriving.
i still had hella fun though.
just cant really walk right now.
Team Bruce: Aaro Landr came in from Minneapolis, rabbit from Chicago, and FLuffy and Britt both recently moved to San Francisco.
Britt Crawford:
I came up out of the BART and there was a group of 6 or so people standing near the exit to the street.
One of them was holding a broom and he was clearly not a sanitation worker.
(It turns out he was person at the park checkpoint) I thought they were probably sf0 players but felt a rush of shyness and just walked on by.
I headed on to the registration area.
People had started to gather.
During the registration period I announced that I was here alone but was looking for a group and Team Bruce was good enough to take me in.
Team Bruce?
Austrailians?
  We talked about our strategy and plotted some routes between the checkpoints.
We weren't going to run much and try to conserve our energy.
Ian announced the start of the event and we took off running.
Our plan was to head up Sacramento instead of California.
It was a lot of other groups' plan as well.
The whole way up Sacramento we could see three or four other groups.
Periodically one group would start to run, the other groups would notice and all of a sudden 20 people are running flatout up the street.
Three quarters of the way to the top of Nob Hill Aaro split off from the group.
Fluffy, Rabbit and I arrived at the Fairmont without interference.
Aaro arrived a few minutes later.
He told us that he had had a close call with a chaser and had relied on his tradecraft to blend in with a crowd at a bus stop.
The couple at the Fairmont were brilliant.
They blended in perfectly with the high class crowd at the hotel, and dealt with the sweaty panting SF0'ers with poise and grace.
We headed out from the Fairmont and decided to split.
Aaro and I went one way and Fluffy and Rabbit went another.
The trip from checkpoint 1 to 2 went without incident.
that despite taking completely different routes we all arrived at point #2 at EXACTLY the same time.
After we left the diner (checkpoint #2), we were all standing on the corner planning our next move when I was suddenly slapped on the back.
So, were Rabbit and Fluffy, a chaser!
Aaro was the only one quick witted enough to escape.
However, when she got us we were still in the safe zone and during the course of his escape Aaro had wandered outisde of the zone, where he was quickly captured.
Rabbit, Fluffy and I were able to make check point #3 but the 10:45p deadline kept getting closer and closer, so we gave up and headed straight for the beach.
We are quitters.
but I had a great time at the beach.
rabbit:
FLuffy Bananachunks:
Aaro Landr: First off, before the event even started I had a very strange feeling overcome me soon after I flew into SFO.
Riding the BART and seeing the Sutro Tower in their physical reality again after playing in the space of SFZero weirded me out a bit.
like I was jacking into the game in a new way.
although most of you actually live here.
Here meaning.
SF, not SF0.
:-)
Fast forwarding to registration on Saturday, Bananachunks, Rabbit and I decided that it might be helpful to recruit \a local\' primarily for help on navigation throughout the city.'
Britt rounded out our team.
After we started running at 19:45, I immediately started debating if running the whole time was really was going to help anyone for this kind of race.
:-) I noticed Nicole and her team waiting at a MUNI stop while our team joined the others running up to Nob Hill.
We also thought that running up Sacramento instead of California would be sneaky but that seemed to be everyone else's idea too.
I split off from the group at around Miles Street and snuck up California alone.
One of my favorite parts of the evening was seeing a silver helmet in the distance and then ducking into a side vestibule of the Fairmont Hotel to find that the door was locked.
I hid in there with my back against the wall for about 30 seconds and right before I was going to duck back out on the street, I saw that same silver helmet with a shit-eating grin sneaking around cars going down the street.
He never saw me although he walked within a couple feet from where I was breathing (I was almost caught!
) After he passed, I quietly walked up into the hotel and met up with the rest of the group.
I loved the juxtaposition of our group of sweaty SF0'ers with the classy wedding gathering in one of the nicest hotels in San Francisco.
We ran around the north side of Huntington Park and most of the people in the park perked their heads up to watch us running and sneaking behind cars, not knowing what was happening.
It was a lovely scene.
Britt and I ended splitting with Rabbit and Bananachunks and we walked all the way down to Market Street.
Britt and I kept trying to find a bus but never found one.
After trying to come in behind point two and finding we were stuck in a weird spot due to the highway, we ended up meeting up with Rabbit and Bananachunks again and snuck in to get a signature.
As the four of us left, we stood outside and tried to determine where to go next.
We also saw Piratey Monkey hop into a car!
Right after, Eris, who was a chaser, ran to tag our group.
She nabbed our entire team except for me while I fled.
I ended up crossing Market on the far side of Laguna watching the aftermath of the tagging.
Apparently, we were all in a safe zone and the tagging didn't count.
At this point, I realized I wasn't in the safe zone and Aynne sneaks up behind me and tags me.
She followed it up with maniacal laughter.
She owned me.
Now that I'm with the chasers, we debated riding the bus with the people still in play (including the rest of my team) but after a long wait I decided to go off on my own to point four.
I picked up a bus on Haight and took it to Parnassus just south of Golden Gate Park.
Wandering around alone in Golden Gate Park without a flashlight isn't recommended.
My only real chance to nab someone was when I saw a guy dart from around Seventh Avenue into the athletic fields.
I assume he was taking a shortcut but I also wasn't sure if he was in play!
I took a long walk through the park looking for players and I don't think I saw any.
I saw a couple groups of four but I didn't feel like attacking them as I wasn't sure if they were in-game or not.
I ended up at Highway 1 and took the 29 to Fulton and sat at Park Presidio for the 5.
Waited for 20 minutes and a woman came by and sat with me.
After a little small talk, I started telling her about SFZero and the game.
I gave her my player business card.
I kept joking that \it must be weird for you to hear me saying all of this.'
When the bus finally arrived, it was humorous to see other chasers.
Some were hiding in the back, I talked with a few near the front, and at one stop a couple people still in-play.
with logs.
got on the bus.
It was hilarious seeing them sit down and look around to see themselves surrounded by chasers.
To the girl I had met at the bus stop, I said, \See?'
We all got off the bus, chatted for a few seconds and then as the bus was about to leave, we realized the players decided to stay on the bus even though we were at the correct stop.
We walked down to the bonfire and the winners, taking a longer route, joined us soon after.
The bonfire: Awesome.
No need to go into great detail here, but we ended up safely getting a Taxi around 4:30am.
Thanks to everyone that put this together, everyone I met, everyone who gave me wine and vodka as well as the SFPD who busted the party but left us alone after we came right back.
I had an excellent time.
I am living in Chicago.
I will continue to live in Chicago for another year and a half, at least.
People ask me to describe why I despise this city so much, and the only thing I can think to say is, 'it's flat it drives me crazy.
'  So this past week I took a last minute trip back to home to the Bay.
I arrived on Friday night, slept in late, had a big breakfast of organic pancakes and fresh homemade smoothie, then cruised under the water to San Francisco.
If there's any way to reintroduce myself to a city, I reasoned, it would be found in an obscure game that advertised getting chased on foot from the embarcadero to the ocean.
I met up with my old friend Qarly, who introduced me to Ed, and so we had a team.
Our plan was to head west, then take a bus up toward Coit Tower, instead of taking the F-line up Embarcadero, which I figured would be overrun with chasers.
The bus didn't come, so we hiked all the way up to Little Italy.
We were halfway up the hill when Ian turned the corner behind us on his bicycle.
I screamed.
Qarly disappeared.
Ed and I hid out for a while, and proceeded much more carefully.
We spotted a chaser with a basketball coming up the street, and ducked into an alleyway.
The plan was to let him pass us by, but we blew it.
We narrowly escaped by splitting up, Ed dodging within feet of the confused chaser, and me stumbling through a narrow garden stairway.
We found each other pretty quickly, and made it to the foot of the tower.
We saw Qarly coming down the steps, and I swore she was wearing a red ribbon, so we hid and let her pass.
Turned out we were paranoid - she hadn't been caught yet.
She would actually end up being the only one of us to make it to the end alive.
Coit to the Hospital wasn't difficult, because Ed and I had fallen so far behind.
We got our second set of signatures and headed for the Morton Salt Girl at Cala Foods.
No buses so far, just pounding pavement.
We had worked out a system where, when approaching a dangerous intersection, we would walk along opposite sides of the street, hugging the wall.
In this way, we figured, we'd be able to spot a chaser coming from the opposite direction and be able to warn each other - no fear of having to step around a corner blind.
This is how we approached Cala.
We rounded the block I had the parking lot in site from the opposite side of the street, and was watching Ed creep up towards it.
There were no chasers present - just a couple of girls walking toward me, chatting casually and enjoying their Saturday night.
As they passed, the smaller one reached out and delicately took hold of my hand.
And that was that.
'I'm sorry,' she said.
I must have looked so confused.
It took me a moment to realize what had happened, and then looked down to see the scrap of red ribbon hanging like a bracelet around her wrist.
Elegant, if I do say so myself.
She gave me a hug, and I shouted over her shoulder for Ed to run.
I switched my ribbon to red, said good-bye to my new chaser friends, and ran off down the street.
I never did get to see the Morton Salt Girl.
So then I was chasing, which turned out to be just as fun as running scared.
I didn't think it would be fair to sneak up on people, so I kept to the spirit of the title and only ran after people who were running away from me.
It just so happens that I run pretty fast, so this wasn't going to be a problem.
I found a pack of players walking toward checkpoint 4.
They saw me immediately (I look pretty conspicuous with a red bandanna around my face), and started running.
I caught up within a block, tagged half of them and let the other half go.
I figured this was going to be the job for me.
until they pulled out little white cards instead of red ribbons.
'What's this?
' I asked, trying to catch my breath, and watched them run back up the street after their companions.
Turns out that the 'helpful items' that everyone said Mr.
Robinson would be handing out were these get-out-of-jail-free cards.
How disappointed I was.
I didn't wait around.
I walked up Geary to Japan Town, where I ran into a pack of four chasers.
They were plotting, discussing strategies, trying to figure out how to catch the players who would be running from checkpoint 4 to the bus stop on Geary.
Meanwhile a woman wrapped in a white sheet walked right by us.
She looked rather like a bum, but at the time I wondered why she was so careful to hide her face as she walked through the group of us (at the Marina, Ed recounted how he had escaped from Cala foods with a girl who disguised herself in a white sheet).
I figured I wouldn't get anywhere hanging around all these chasers, so I went down to the bus stop where I found a bunch of players hugging the safe zone.
We talked, reasoned that I wasn't willing to wait, and I let them be.
I'd get them later.
So I found a bus stop where I ran into another chaser, and we caught a bus together.
We figured it would be wiser to keep going, and head people off at checkpoint 5 or 6.
I wanted to go to checkpoint 5 he was a little more interested in going straight to checkpoint 7.
I figured we weren't going to be the best at working together.
The bus was empty, but as soon as we got on, two more chasers got on behind us.
At the next stop, we picked up four players.
How convenient one for each of us.
Buses being safe zones, we were friendly.
I offered up my trail mix, which most of them took.
The players moved to the back of the bus to discuss strategy, and so did we.
After a minute, the players presented this dilemma:  they had, each of them, the 'powerful object' which would grant them escape.
By the wording on these cards, all chasers in the area would have to freeze for 60 seconds after being handed one of the cards.
This meant, of course, that as long as they stuck together, we would have to chase them down four consecutive times before we could legitimately tag them.
This disuaded my fellow chasers quite a bit, and the three of them exited the bus, intending to transfer to another bus that would take them closer to checkpoint 5.
This, however, forced the players to stay on the bus, and I stayed with them, and so we rolled farther south, farther and farther away from checkpoint 5.
They were very soldierly when they finally got the nerve to exit, letting the slower runners exit first, while the fastest runner kept me blocked in the stairwell until the last possible moment.
When he and I got off, I unexpectedly declined to tag him, but instead ran after the other players who were already halfway up the street.
I caught up with the smallest one, tagged her, got my card, and counted patiently to 60.
A few minutes later I caught up with the lot of them at the next bus stop.
I offered them water, but none of them accepted.
The bus was packed myself and one of the other players had to hang in the stairwell in order to stay on.
I figured I would ride with them until checkpoint 5, take another card from them, and so pursue the pack all the way to the finish.
This plan was slightly improvised on when, in a moment of bravery, one of the players bolted out of the bus at an empty stop, just as the doors were closing.
I barely made it out after him, dropped my red ribbon on the pavement, went back to pick it up, giving him a decisive lead.
I caught up two blocks down.
I have to say that ditching his friends was a genius move on his part, for which I give him the credit of me not catching a single ribbon all night - he even tried to negotiate resting for a few minutes before handing over his card, but I wasn't quite so gullible.
He jogged off into the neighborhood again and hid, and so I lost him and all the other players I was after.
I pulled out my map, and made my way, incredibly sluggish from all the running, to checkpoint 5.
It was at checkpoint 5 that I realized that I was spent.
My feet were killing me, my knees were weak, and my left hip threatened to buckle if I even though about running again.
I followed a couple of players up a hill, sticking to the shadows, and only started chasing when I was within a hundred feet and they'd caught sight of me.
I lost them both in a mess of parked cars.
I sat down on the curb across from the safe zone to catch my breath and basically had to watch as another 8 players dodged past me.
Exhausted, I stumbled after each one in turn, but I couldn't catch any of them.
After finishing off my water bottle, I trudged away.
I didn't see another player all the way through the Presidio, past checkpoint 6, or on the road to the Marina.
I'd resigned myself to defeat by then, of course, because I wouldn't have been able to chase a pregnant cow if she'd fallen down in front of me.
And so I made it all the way out to the docks, where a pack of chasers had set up camp in order to pick off the stragglers.
There I found two of the players that I'd taken cards away from, and lo-and-behold.
they were sporting red ribbons!
But the most amazing part of all.
on the path out to the Wave Organ I saw three people in evening attire walking out of the darkness toward me - with unmistakably bushy hair.
My eyes focused on three old friends: Avery, Wei and Lauren, who had just come from a party at the Yacht club, where our highschool friends Ana Lisa and Macy were celebrating their wedding.
And so, tired, sweaty and filthy, having not spoken to either of them in 7 years, I snuck into the yacht club and gave them my personal congratulations (I hope you two have a brilliant time!
I am overjoyed to see old friends looking so happy!
)
My deepest thanks to all involved, I had a wonderful time!
This was the perfect reintroduction to San Francisco, and the most satisfying break from the mundane landscape of the midwest (though my legs will disagree - I was limping for four days, and the blister on my right foot began to fester and I had to buy new shoes).
And that was only the beginning of the most wonderful vacation ever!
but the rest of my week will have to be another story.
I should have seen the signs, should have known that dinner was a harbinger for the night to come.
We met at the Pint for dinner a few blocks away from the starting line.
And immediately claimed the upstairs area for our group of intrepid runners.
Except the upstairs loft at the pint is not ideal for relaxing, the ceiling it too low, the insulation too good and while the air was filled with 'hail fellows' and 'well mets' it was also filled with grousing about being too hot and sweaty, and paranoid looks at the ceiling.
In hindsight this was merely preparation.
The night itself was excellent for running about in a confused mob, despite some early sprinkles the rain held off and we were treated to the ominous glowering of clouds above our heads while the light held out.
Upon reaching the starting line, the dry fountain in Wicker Park off Damen, we gathered up other racers from team FOECakes and started plotting strategery.
Mostly this consisted of wild ideas and attempts to find loopholes in the rules but eventually we decided our best bet was to run to the first checkpoint, bypassing the trains entirely.
It was then the true work of the night started, the bitching.
Some bitched they were too old to run the entire way, some bitched they were too out of shape, some were smokers, some had the wrong shoes, one or two were too uncoordinated.
But oh the bitching, it was glorious in its diversity.
We attempted to one up each other.
I was both old and out of shape, but others were old, had bad knees and were wearing bright clothes that would make them easy targets for the chasers.
At the mention of chasers all eyes would go to those, well maybe not menacing, not yet at least, figures with red arm bands.
In particular the chaser in the red hooded cloak on the bike, we may have even scoffed a bit then, not knowing what we know now.
Finally it was time for action.
People started drifting off in the direction of the first checkpoint until we were reminded that we didn't know what we were looking for yet.
After receiving final instructions the whistle blew and we were off.
Across the park and into the Burger King parking lot, through the drive thru (the wrong way) and across the street to the startlement of drivers.
Finally we hit the back allies to cries of 'slow down' and 'wait for me' and 'fuck'.
Though mostly that last one.
We made our way, in a more of less solid mass of 10-15 sometimes seeing other groups but staying away from them, or using them as stalking horses for any chasers.
We made it to the first checkpoint without incident.
No chasers, and it looked as though we were one of the first groups.
After some celebratory cupcakes we continued on in a much more jovial mood.
This wasn't so bad, let the chasers come, we'd take them.
Ha ha ha.
And then we spotted her.
The chaser in the red cloak.
At first the group froze, like rabbits, and then panic kicked in and we ran around the corner looking for cover.
Like filthy hobbit cowering along the side of the road.
We watched as she chased down some poor bastard from astride her bike.
Hoping she wouldn't look behind her and see us, trapped.
Eventually she rode out of sight and we resumed, but much more cautiously.
Â  
Everything proceeded smoothly for the next 5 to 10 minutes as we advanced cautiously towards the next checkpoints while slowly stringing out.
Â  This came to an end as we trotted down a side street as a blood curdling scream rent the night air and cries of 'Chaser!
Â  Motherfucking Chaser!
 echoed up and down our line.
Â  
Panic erupted.
Â  No, seriously.
Â  If you've seen Cloverfield you know what I mean.
Â  People started yelling and running down the street looking over their shoulders.
Â  Of course it was a false alarm.
Â  But still, it was the single most awesome thing I saw all night.
Â  I only wish I hadn't been running too fast to take a picture.
Â  
Eventually we slowed down, gasping and panting.
Â  And bitching.
Â  Definitely bitching.
Â  By this point the complaints of 'I smell gross' and 'I'm all fucking sweaty' and 'Holy shit I got a wedgie' were added to the bitching roster.
Â  After a brief bitch session at a slow walk the pace picked up again as we neared the second checkpoint.
I put on my hunting gear.
I have fond recollections of hunting in the past: Journey '08 and Architect '09.
I stand tall on the hill, with my bicycle and red armband, as the large crowd turns to look in horror at the three of us \official\' chasers that start with bicycles.'
Only a small handful of blues who are friends, know that my left knee is blown out.
(Look how they smile so nicely at me before the game.
not afraid at all, alas.
) 

My goal is to add to the threatening ambiance and to exhaust the herd.
not to actually catch them.
A small group of blues try to break off early, but the larger crowd boos them until they wander back.
After a few final announcements they are released to run.
I watch hundreds of participants pour out of the park in all possible directions.
The air is sharp with spring chill and the sun is low in the sky.
My first duty is to assist at Checkpoint 1B, which is just 100 yards from this prior Stripping task and a few blocks from my apartment.
I ride my bike at a very slow pace, periodically whistling at or calling out to blues, which mostly run from the sight of me.
There is something very satisfying and somewhat disturbing about having large groups of relative strangers running in fear from me.
It reminds me of the five beautiful, wonderful seasons I worked at a wicked haunted house many years ago.
As I make my way to 1B, meandering the streets and alleyways, I happen upon a herd of about 12-14 blues.
They begin running, but it's a long block and I call out to them: \Come here my Pretties!'
\We can't outrun her bike
Lucky for me, half the group is in partial-panic and doesn't listen to him, so I follow alongside them until they hit a street corner and I can rush them on the sidewalk.
Feels good to exhaust them early for future chasers.
I am almost to the checkpoint when a small group of four blues begins running from me along a busy street.
Three dart around a corner, but the fourth is doubled-over breathing heavily.
I ride up next to him.
\You aren't to the first checkpoint yet.'
\Catch me.'
I oblige him and honorably take his blue ribbon, wishing him well.
I arrive at Checkpoint 1B.
Excited players, pumped up about making it to a checkpoint, surround us volunteers.
The blues must write \something you want to do before you die\' wishes onto stickers before I sign off their maps and send them on to their destinies.'
There are so many people that keep arriving, staggering numbers at times.
After an hour or so, a volunteer starts singing a 10-stanza Star Trek song that seemingly never ends and we shut down the checkpoint.
Whisking home for something a bit warmer, I change into my next outfit for the dark of night.
My next duty is to see how things are progressing at Checkpoint 4.
I ride up there, interrupting a group of 8-10 blues that were lazily sauntering up the street, by quickly and quietly gliding up on my bike and jumping off with a yell.
They scatter to the winds, sprinting, leaping, and perhaps even squealing a bit.
It's good to keep the herds on their toes.
I arrive at Checkpoint 4 to discover that the place is already swarming with players who have been turned Red.
they are scouring the streets for blues.
I pass on a little intel.
Deciding to meet up with Monk and Julian, I ride up to Checkpoint 5.
I take my time and chase or taunt any blues I see along the way.
Arriving at 5, I am mildly taunted by two large groups of blues standing in a safe-zone.
I grin at them and move along to meet up with my comrades.
For the next hour or so, I ride around the area between Checkpoints 5 and 6.
Blues run from me.
They duck into alleyways and hide behind dumpsters.
They dart into building courtyards amidst the bushes.
They sprint to corners and hide in doorways.
They climb fences and leap curbs and crawl in brambles to avoid detection.
They freeze in place and stare intently at me to see if I've noticed the movement.
I ride by them, smiling, pleased at how creative they have become in avoiding getting caught by this stage in the game.
There are two very enthusiastic former-blues who have fully embraced their chaser roles.
They hunger for all intel on where blues are and proudly proclaim how many they have caught.
She's gotten 5, he's gotten 3.
A group that is mostly turned red sees me and one of them runs up to me, bowing, offering me his blue ribbon as a sign of respect.
I humbly accept.
They are done for the night and heading home after a fun night of running.
I arrive at Checkpoint 6.
Some of my friends are already here.
Some arrive later.
There are blues and there are reds.
There are participants and there are volunteers.
There is food and drink and laughter and storytelling.
It is another amazing Journey to the End of the Night: Chicago.
Thank you to the organizers, especially Beetle Bomb.
You are all amazing.
Prologue
Meredithian: The decision to join in the L.
Journey was a spur of the moment one for me, but I couldn't resist once I knew the Austinites and some of my fellow FOÃ?cakes were going, including Mr.
G who had lived in L.
for a few years.
Gummy Bears: One of the green gummies journeyed to the end of the night alone as part of the SFZEROPRACTICAL exam, so the Green Team vowed to participate in a real Journey, despite the inherent risks of interacting with unknown humans.
Armbands, they knew, were useless on gummies, so they made themselves blue runner hats and red chaser hats.
Evil Sugar asked if they wanted water bottles, but the bears declined.
Gummies, they said, do not drink water.
They drink frosting.
Evil Sugar told the gummies that they could have frosting after the race was complete.
Ayma Mack: Being that this would be my first journey as well as my first time to LA, I spent a considerable amount of time preparing.
I studied the maps, read all the praxis from the Chicago journey, and enjoyed a few beers in the process.
At O'Hare, the mood was set for the next day by a terribly scary cookie.
I posted a few pics of O'Hare, boring, I know, but my luggage was lost en route and they are the only ones I have to share!
Sparrows: We had been lucky with our flights (Ayma Mack: Except for the part where American lost my luggage!
), so everyone got into LAX within hours of each other the morning of Journey.
We dumped our stuff at a friend's house we were staying at, took quick showers and got our running shoes on.
Then we went out and scarfed down some energy foods at Fred 62's.
Some of us were running for the first time, and some of us were coming back from a triumphant Chicago Journey.
Some wanted to be the first to finish, and some wanted only to survive.
We were full of a wired kind of tension, and kept pulling out maps of L.
to examine for ideas.
I was narrowly convinced to abandon my Thomas Guide, which I had planned to haul along with me.
Ah, Thomas Guide.
We reached the gathering point to find it was already full of potential runners.
We were in this little park at the base of a big mountain.
The sun was setting, and the streets held their breath in balmy anticipation.
We were at the edge of the crowd and so didn't have a good look at who was telling everyone the rules - was it
Lincoln?
Tom O'Tillo?
We talked about pushing forward, but then we'd be trapped in the crowd when it was time to break.
We stayed put, examining the map.
So we totally weren't ready when the horn blew, and everyone went running.
Mr G: After the Chicago's Journey, I was totally psyched for another one, and I love LA.
Approaching the starting point was really exciting.
I was surprised by the turnout, and apprehensive about the competitors, knowing full well that many would likely become my enemy over the course of the night.
But after a successful run in Chicago, I was confident that we'd finish on top.
Rainy: I just wanted to survive the night.
But I donâ??t run very fast, so I knew Iâ??d have to be alert and clever.
If possible.
Okay, maybe just alert.
From Start to Checkpoint 1

(Ayma Mack: Since my camera was captured by AA, I drew for the rest of the journey)

We hauled ass up to Hollywood, figuring we'd be safe amongst the touristy shops.
It was very surreal, looking down and seeing the hollywood stars at our feet, while certain that chasers would be upon us in seconds - a sensation that was to prove a little psychic.
We were only halfway to Checkpoint 1 when Mr.
G screamed, 'Chaser!
' and we bolted, hurtling down the boulevard and dodging through people.
Meredithian: Other than to survive until the end, my sub-goals for Journey LA were to be less cautious and finish with a faster time than I did with Journey Chicago, and to be more tied to the group I had chosen to run with.
My experiences in the Chicago Journey told me that when in danger my first instinct was to save myself, and I was not very happy with that revelation.
But old habits die hard, and when from the very beginning the chasers hit, I was off and running away from the rest of my team.
My first instinct was to run in the opposite direction from everyone else, away from the main street rather than along it, then darting across and heading down the first side street I saw.
I was hoping I could duck between some houses or in an alley or something to escape.
It happened so fast it wasn't until I was out of view from the rest of the team and fairly safe that I realized I had abandoned the team.
It wasn't until I slackened up that I noticed for the first time wasn't alone.
G had been alongside me on the street and then ran over by my side.
His presence both reassured me and made me uncomfortable I both wanted and was afraid to be alone.
We found some trash bins to duck behind and tried to find out what became of the rest of the team but couldn't see them.
We decide to head on to Checkpoint one and hope they met us there.
G: I was unpleasantly surprised with how many chasers there were along Los Feliz blvd, right near the staring point.
So early in the game were we ambushed, and we all scattered.
I couldn't tell who were chasers and runners, so I ran without looking back.
I successfully ran down a side street and was pleased to find that Meredithian had taken the same route.
I was happy to see she wasn't nabbed, but afraid for the rest of my group.
We continued on, without hesitation, to Checkpoint 1, which we did without running in to any other chasers.
Gummies: So many humans, all gathered in one place.
It was all the gummies could do to not get stepped on.
They decided to hide until most of the humans had gone.
It was a good plan, a perfect plan â?? except that the gummies didn't have a map.
When the starting area had cleared, they were uncertain which way to go.
They set off in what they hoped was the right direction, and quickly became lost.
Being out in the human world made the gummies feel very small and very alone.
The rest of us kept together and managed to catch up to and pass some poor runner we didn't know â?? the chaser went for her instead, and we escaped unscathed.
Rainy: When the chasers surprised us we scattered and I dodged various passersby, almost ran into a wookie, ( ) ) and then caught sight of Sparrows, and we managed to get away.
Sparrows: I glanced back once as the chaser took her ribbon â?? I think it might have been Loki.
Meredithian: Getting to checkpoint one was easier and faster than I had imagined.
Once we were there I felt a blast of nostalgia from when I had visited LA the first time, to pick up Mr.
G and drive him along with all his possessions across the country to my apartment in Chicago.
We had visited Griffith park during that trip and we had a fantastic day, hiking up the mountain, checking out the museum, catching up on years living apart and planning for the future of years living much closer together.
But this was no time for woolgathering, and so we quickly moved on.
After that we were paranoid and jumpy, certain that everyone whose arm we couldn't see was a chaser.
None of us could take our eyes off our surroundings long enough to phone Mr.
G and Meredithian.
From Checkpoint 1 to Checkpoint 2
We decided to go along Hyperion Avenue to reach Checkpoint 2.
We managed to stop long enough to get a good shot of a beautiful bridge:

Beyond that the street was full of bars and restaurantsâ?¦ just the sorts of places a chaser could wait within, ready to jump out at us.
We had calmed down a little, and people were phoning Mr.
G and Meredithian and trying to get everyone regrouped, with all the mistrust and cross-checking of, 'Are you a chaser?
' 'No, are YOU a chaser?
' that that sort of business involves.
Meredithian: Getting to checkpoint two, again, was kind of a breeze.
I had the usual feeling of paranoia, and kept looking over my shoulder and carefully crossing intersections where I thought we might be seen.
but overall, it was calm.
Though I never really relaxed, I started to look around for the first time.
I remember Mr.
telling me the first time I was in LA that no one really walked anywhere.
Truthfully, there didn't seem to be anyone just walking around, even when we passed by seemingly commercial areas.
I started to see this as a good sign for the game - if you did see someone walking, it was good reason to automatically be suspicious.
Overall, though, not seeing anyone made me think we were making good time.
I felt a little bad for our teammates, not knowing where they were - phone communications seemed to be failing us as whenever I tried to call Sparrows Fall I went straight to voicemail.
I would have feared for the worst, but my phone had been doing that all day whenever I had tried to call her, so I tried to hope for the best and stay positive.
I was disappointed we didn't see them at the first checkpoint but thought maybe we were way ahead of them.
Even though I was excited at the possibility of a lead, I thought I would suggest we wait a bit at Checkpoint 2 and see if they showed up.
G: Our clue for checkpoint 2 was 'a VIEW of los feliz.
' We headed to the intersection of Sunset and Hollywood.
Sticking to small streets and dark alleys, we made it without incident.
In fact, we didn't even see many other runners.
This was surprising so early in the game.
Were we way ahead or way behind?
Had they all gotten tagged?
Who knew, but we kept moving.
By the time we left checkpoint 2, we had been reunited with our group, wholly intact with blue ribbons.
Except the gummies.
Upon arriving, we found that the 'VIEW' meant the Vista theater.
Sure enough, we found two people dressed as Batman and the Joker.
Was this a promotion to the new movie?
No, it was the checkpoint people.
(almost like Batman and the Joker.
)
 
Rainy: I wished we could stop at Trader Joeâ??s.
I miss trader Joeâ??s.
Also, I was hungry.
Along Hyperion I was nervous as we went we tried to find groups of regular folk to blend with  here and there this got easier when we hit Sunset.
Iâ??m fond of Sunset.
Did you know you can take Sunset all the way through the canyons to the coast?
Usually when Iâ??m out in the LA area, Iâ??m out there visiting my mom.
It was a great relief to rejoin as a group.
I like the Vista, too my first job was at The Rialto in South Pasadena, and I love old theaters.
We got to Checkpoint 2 without much further trouble.
From Checkpoint 2 to Checkpoint 3
We made good time out of Checkpoint 2.
We saw a few chasers in the distance, but managed not to attract their attention.
We spotted a group of players ahead of us, with blue ribbons on their arms, and followed them for a while.
We were eager, and kept almost catching up â?? we got close enough at one point to see that it was Waldo Cheerio, Tac Haberdash, and the Walrus.
We all exchanged wary smiles, and then we let them pull ahead of us again.
They would be making better time, but they'd also be the first to trigger any hidden chasers.
Gummies:  After wandering lost for a while, the gummies spotted a group of chasers, clustered around a building with a hot dog on top.
The gummies waited.
The chasers waited.
The chasers looked bored.
Then suddenly all the chasers took off at top speed.
The gummies ran to the giant-hot-dog building and discovered they had reached Checkpoint 3.
More importantly, the humans running the checkpoint were giving out cupcakes!
At first, the humans tried to give the entire green team only one cupcake, but the green team insisted that each gummy bear needed their own cupcake.
The gummy bears licked all the frosting off their cupcakes, leaving the cake part for Evil Sugar.
Happy and full of frosting, the green team napped for several minutes (which is over a year of hibernation in gummy time).
When they woke up, more humans had arrived at the checkpoint, including their good friends Rainy and Sparrows Fall.
Ayma Mack: I was so hungry by this point that I almost stopped running for a bit just to eat but I was persuaded to keep on going.
At one point I shrieked and ran from a stranger who came up to me, but all they wanted was a cigarette.
Lucky for me though we made it to the third checkpoint safely, and to find what?
An abundance of food.
Thai food, yum.
But I was massively confused at the fact that there was a tofu-covered hot dog on the roof of a Thai restaurant.
These Californians are weird!
Anyhoo - to make things even better there were CUPCAKES to be had, and I LOOOOOOVE cupcakes.
Rainy: Things were seeming a little weird at this point, to me.
And I donâ??tmean the giant food of mixed proteins.
We have plenty of giant food in Austin.
I was just feeling weird, kind of like I was doing mushrooms.
Which made the cupcakes a good thing.
Mmm, cupcakes.
I ate two and was glad to be rejoined by the gummies and Evil.
We had to drag Ayma Mack away from the Thai food once we got going again.
He had a lot of 'help' finishing his order.
We decided to head down Western to Santa Monica, then east to the cemetery, where Checkpoint 4 lay.
From Checkpoint 3 to Checkpoint 4
Gummies:  The gummies decided to split up.
Too many gummies all together, they decided, would attract more human attention than gummies traveling alone or in pairs.
Also, they were getting tired.
Meredithian kindly volunteered to carry a gummy in her pocket.
G: Between the hot dog and the cemetery, we did run into a bit of excitement.
We thought about taking side streets, but not knowing the neighborhood kept us from doing so.
It was risky along Western, it being so open and such a direct path, but we decided to risk it.
Upon approaching a couple of chasers, we started to slow down, but knew we had to think fast.
Meredithian quickly said 'I can take them,' and took off running.
The rest of us were shocked by such quick thinking, and hung back pretending like we didn't know her.
Meredithian sprinted down a side street.
The chasers looked at her, then at us, then at her again, and took the bait, sprinting off after her.
We were greatful, but worried.
Would we find Meredithian waiting for us at checkpoint 4?
Or did she nobly sacrifice herself for the sake of the group?
Only time would tell.
Meredithian: This time when we saw chasers, my extremely latent heroism finally kicked into action.
I did run away from everyone, but first I ran towards the chasers a bit, to try and lead them on.
I made them force into a kind of flanking pattern, not sure if they would buy it.
but they did!
I could feel them behind me and then suddenly was really scared I wouldn't be able to get away!
I spared a glance back, however, to find that both chasers were with me and my team had safely gotten away.
All I had to focus on now was saving myself, and this time I didn't even have to feel guilty about it.
This spurred me on, and with a burst of adrenaline, I went sprinting down the road without looking behind me.
I went for several blocks before checking behind me, and when I glanced back I saw the chasers, standing two blocks away - they had gotten tired and stopped.
Rainy: Moving as a pack, we were headed down Western when Mr.
G spotted some chasers.
And Meredithian took the heat!
I would have done it.
Meredithian: I found myself far off course, with no one around.
I took out the map.
I could go all the way back and hope the chasers weren't waiting for me, or I could try to make my way along the roads and hope I met up with everyone.
I didn't want to call them - I may have been heroic, but I wasn't going to risk that they'd all been caught anyway, and were about to lure me into some kind of trap.
And then I saw a bus!
I hopped onto it immediately then looked over the map trying to figure out where it was heading - luckily it was going in the right direction.
I got off near the checkpoint and warily approached, but there were no chasers around.
Unfortunately there was no one I knew there, either - were they ahead of me or behind me?
How much time had I lost, distracting the chasers?
Green Gummy: I rode the bus!
I rode the bus!
(The green gummy was very excited about this because the Yellow Team had gotten to ride the bus to work with Rainy one time, and it sounded fun.
)
From Checkpoint 4 to Checkpoint 5
Gummies:  SO TIRED!
Rainy: The neighborhood got kind of dog-eared, and there were some rumors filtering to us about heavy chaser activity ahead.
I gave a couple of the gummies, who were very tuckered out, a lift in one of my pockets.
I was still feeling weird, and this wasnâ??t helped a feeling of vertigo (kind of twisty feeling, like I was turning into one of the twisty junipers all over LAâ?¦which I like, but I didnâ??t want to turn into one) and a sudden strange fog drifting up from the gutters.
Gummies:  Yay Rainy!
Yay pockets!
We were heading north on Vine when we ducked into an alley while Sparrows tied her shoe.
When Rainy peered back onto the street she saw a chaser that had just come around the corner, so we retreated further into the alley.
We decided to cut through the alley and then move north again to avoid the chaser.
But when we got through it, it opened up into a small street that didn't seem to go anywhere, with another alley on the other side of it.
We ducked into that one, too, getting nervous now â?? what if we couldn't get back on track?
At the same time some weird fog was coming up, making it hard to see very far ahead.
We'd reached the other end of the second alley when we heard a shout and running feet, right on top of us â?? if we ran, too, we'd make too much noise.
We flattened ourselves against the walls of the alley.
If the runner turned down our alley we were totally screwed.
But luckily the blue-ribboned guy sprinted by the mouth of the alley and kept on going.
We heard a tremendous pounding of feet as the pack of pursuing chasers closed the gap between them and their victim â?? they shot across the mouth of the alley.
We only saw them for a second, but it was enough to freeze us in place.
They burst from the fog and were gone so fast we couldn't be sure it was really them, but in that moment we swore we saw Piratey Monkey, and Cameron , and P00n, and Gadget, running full tilt, red ribbons marking their arms, glee on their faces.
We waited for several long minutes after they had gone by, then crept from the alley, moving as fast as we could.
The fog lifted soon after, and we made the checkpoint.
Meredithian: At this point I was making time on my own.
I made it to Checkpoint 5 with relative ease, at some points I felt like running even when I didn't have to, partially out of latent adrenaline and partly just because running felt good.
I stuck to alleys parallel to main streets to draw less attention to myself and always slowed up and tried to look casual at major street crossings.
I was alone, but unlike Chicago I was on track and moving fast.
I felt free, and strong, but I also hoped my friends were okay.
From Checkpoint 5 to Checkpoint 6
The majority of the trip had gone pretty well for us.
We only had a few run-ins with chasers, and, though being split up once or twice along the way, as we approached the final checkpoint, our core group was still intact.
Though nothing could prepare us for the hell that was Hollywood Blvd.
We knew we were in trouble heading up Cahuenga when we saw a suspicious figure on his cell phone.
He seemed to be doing the 'ole 'pretend I'm on my cell phone to hide my ribbon' bit.
We reluctantly moved forward - his intentions became clear to everyone at the same moment.
We darted across the street just in time for a traffic light to change.
We all made it, but he was still on the other side of the great divide.
We didn't stop running, but noticed that he decided not to pursue us - perhaps intimidated by our agility, or perhaps seeking other prey.
Hollywood Blvd was a nightmare, mostly because it was packed with tourists, and we didn't know who was a chaser and who was a runner and who was a tourist.
We stuck close together, hoping to conceal each others' ribbons as much as possible without cheating.
While clutching each other tight as fear overcame us, a chaser walked right past us without looking at us.
We must have been blending in well.
We saw another group of runners not too far ahead of us, and decided to steady our pace with theirs so that any pack of chasers would hit them first.
This worked for a while, but when we passed Highland Ave, we noticed a Michael Jackson impersonator was actually a chaser impersonating an impersonator!
He went after the group in front of us.
Two girls got tagged immediately, and the other two from their group ran into the mall.
Thankfully, Michael Jackson/the Michael Jackson impersonator/the chaser followed them in after gathering the other girls' blue ribbons.
They looked like they were quitting, since they didn't put on their red ribbons - which was good for us.
We didn't have to contend with other chasers (as if there weren't enough).
Michael Jackson turned out to be the calm before the storm, for our biggest threat was yet to come.
We continued on warily, and soon the safe zone for the final Checkpoint was only a block away.
There were people in the street, but we didn't see any chasers.
We glanced at each other.
'Run?
'
'Run.
'
We sprinted for the safe zone, and made it halfway down the block when from behind car after car chasers stood up.
We still don't know how many there were - it seemed like at least twenty or thirty of them, though we knew that was impossible.
We were like the tide crashing up onto the beach - it was chaos.
Gummies:  At this point, only one gummy remained with Evil Sugar.
The gummy heard something, a very faint pitter patter.
GUMMY CHASER!
We started screaming.
Some of us went right for the chasers, some of us turned back, and some of us tried to go around them.
Sparrows: Here's where I got chasered.
I went right for the chasers, and tried to draw them off.
I figured I'd be fast enough to be a distraction, but I was wrong - I drew off two of them, but they caught me in short order.
Luckily I could slow them down for a bit while they waited for me to take off my ribbon.
Take that, reds.
Runner Gummy:  The gummy with Evil Sugar was now the only gummy not turned to a chaser.
Run faster, the gummy told Evil Sugar.
They wove through tourists.
Chaser Gummies:  BLOOD!
ALL WILL BE TAKEN!
NONE WILL SURVIVE.
We broke down some side streets, and luckily didn't find chasers waiting at the other end for us.
We made it around onto streets clear of chasers, and from there into the final safe zone.
Runner Gummy:  Evil Sugar spotted Sparrows, but she was wearing the red armband!
It was too late to hide, the only thing to do was to sprint for the finish.
Evil Sugar ran, but Sparrows didn't follow.
Sparrows had other plans.
Sparrows: So.
I hadn't made it through, which sucked.
On the other hand, I was a chaser, which rocked.
I scooped up some of the nearby chaser gummies, who could not move very fast with their tiny gummy legs, and slid behind a car near the theatre, just at the edge of the safe zone.
I waited until some poor sod of a runner was almost on top of me, and then stood, and in that second of terrified recognition, launched the chaser gummies directly at them.
Direct hit!
Then we got to have a discussion about what counted as tagging or not.
After the ribbon hats on the gummies were properly examined, it was decided that it did.
Meredithian: I had made it to the safety zone outside the last checkpoint independent of the group, though I saw them once in the midst of chaos from afar - I considered trying to join up but it looked impossible and using the distraction while it was available I forged ahead.
I am glad I wasn't nearby in a way when Sparrows was endangered and chasered because I'm sure it would have made me sad, and I probably would have tried to do something silly to save us and ending up getting us both caught.
Also, I'm fairly certain that had I been nearby when she got her red ribbon, she would have lunged after me.
though I'm not sure she could have caught me.
I ran into the rest of the group at the finish, having just beaten them there.
We had made it - or most of us had anyway.
G: Overall, I really enjoyed Journey: LA.
In the end, team FOEcakes, again, came out on top.
There were some sticky moments, but I knew we could do it.
By the end, I was exhausted, but I was happy not to have sustained any injuries.
The experience will last with me for a long time.
Gummies:  Go Team Foecakes!
Meredithian: I'm glad to have participated in another journey, and to have not just survived, but really ran and challenged myself to be faster.
I'm also proud to say that I didn't always abandon my teammates and friends when in danger this time around.
I think I'm ready for a strong race in Minneapolis come September.
Rainy: So, as others in the group have said, the last leg was hairy and scary.
As we approached Graumannâ??s, though, I was fatally distracted.
There was someone selling those laquered Chinese paper parasols!
I found one painted with dragons and cats--how could I leave it behind?
I couldnâ??t.
Just as I was paying for my umbrella, there was a tap on my shoulder.
At least I wouldnâ??t have to chase any of my team mates.
Ayma Mack: Somehow, still wearing the clothes I came from Chicago in, I managed to make it to the final checkpoint without getting caught.
There were close moments, and I was alone for parts of the route, but in the end it was totally worth the 'Journey' (haha, bad pun.
) And the best part.
I noticed I had a voicemail while we were hanging out at the last checkpoint.
It was AA and they had found my luggage.
in Boston!
Our team, The End User Case, came in with 3 out of 5.
Aynne and Eris were tagged out and became chasers, but Nicole, Sean and Jason all made it to the end relatively unscathed and with a full manifest.
Jason has some photos on Flickr, as does Aynne.
Dig all Journey to the End of the Night photos and also peruse the SF0 Flickr group.
Jason:
Pregame
I picked up Nicole around 5:30 so we could get dinner together and try to find a parking space downtown.
Succeeding in both, we were early to registration and caught up with Ian, Sean and Sam.
More people arrived, some I knew, some I didn't know.
I was in a kind of shy mood so I didn't go up and introduce myself to many people, unfortunately.
Still, these new-to-me people might become future enemies during the night, so perhaps best to play it safe.
Meanwhile, a friend and coworker of mine that was intending to come called to say that he had lost his house keys on the Golden Gate Bus, so he had to figure out how he'd be spending the weekendâ??in his place or not.
I still don't know what happened to him.
Like Vladypus said, when we saw that teams were possible, he, Kelly, Nicole and I started to team up, as at that point we were expecting one more (that would be Eris).
But then Vlad and Kelly decided to go it on their own, which ended up working out.
Eris had brought her friend Sean, and then our friend Aynne called me to see if she was too late to get into the race.
Aynne made it but had brought another friend, David, but he ended up in another team with people he knew.
With our team finalized I dubbed it The End User Case because it was the only thing I could think of.
But everyone seemed to like it, so it was done.
As all this organizing was going on, we all got outfitted with blue and purple ribbons to designate racer/chaser status, a map of the race course, and free 1\ buttons for the taking.'
Jason
5-4-3-2-1-go.
I didn't see which direction everyone went I just know at least half of us ran northwest and through some shopping/hotel complex to get to California Street.
We saw many people running on uphill on foot, but we opted to catch the bus right off the bat, with the intention of pacing ourselves.
After 10 minutes waiting for the bus, however, we needed to think of alternatives.
Eris has this brilliant idea of calling the hotel, claiming to have a reservation under the name Jones at the hotel's restaurant, and telling them that the bus was nowhere to be found.
could they send a shuttle?
No dice, they didn't go for it.
Shortly thereafter, a bus appeared around the corner and we were heading up California.
A few other players got on along the way, including Aaro, whose group had been split up by chasers.
The folks in purple apparently meant to get it started early.
Hearing that we were trying to get into the hotel, an uninvolved passenger on the bus told us about a side entrance.
We thanked him but it didn't register, since we all went for the front door, anyway.
The bus almost made it to Mason Street, but right before, it got stuck uphill behind a double-parked car.
By that time many of us were standing by the exit door in back, in anticipation of the scramble to the demilitarized, chaser-neutral zone, and when the bus driver asked us if we wanted off there, we all responded with an emphatic, \Yes!'
Checkpoint 1 â?? 950 Mason Street â?? The Fairmont Hotel
We saw players coming out of the hotel.
well, honestly it seemed like every player besides those of us who just got off the bus was coming out of the hotel, and I don't know how they got uphill so fast on foot.
We went inside, found our contacts (which turned out to be Ian's parents), got info on the next contact (a woman in a brown trenchcoat), got our signatures and were back out the front door.
Except there were at least two chasers on bicycles, circling like sharks to catch anyone who went the obvious direction.
Eris (I think) again to the rescue: back into the hotel, we searched for the back entrance on Powell Street.
We had to go down a floor but we found it.
Eris and Sean poked their heads out, saw the coast was clear, and we ran two blocks downhill towards Market Street before I asked them to slow down.
A lot of running downhill meant my gut bouncing, meaning my recent appendectomy scar getting agitated, and I wanted to avoid potential problems.
They kindly acquiesced, but with red lights it turned out to be the same in terms of timing.
Keeping an eye out for purple bicyclists, we made our way down to Market Street and the plaza at the cable car turntable.
Not knowing who was around, we ran from the cover of buildings across the plaza and down the stairs to the MUNI subway station.
A panhandler addressed us on the way down, saying, \Slow down!'
On the L (K?
), we discussed our options: get out at Van Ness and take the direct route, or try going to the Church Street stop and doubling back, with less chasers stationed on the back door?
Aynne pointed out that the Van Ness stop meant any running to safety would be done uphill, so we went with the Church Street option.
Going down Market in the open, we thought maybe we had made it there quickly enough that the chasers wouldn't have had time to station themselves there, but no.
Just before we got to the intersection with Laguna/Guerrero, a man talking on a cell phone andâ??we noticed too lateâ??a purple ribbon sticking out of his hat got not ten feet in front of us before he shut his phone and said, \Hi!'
Right after his greeting, Aynne broke left towards the street, and the chaser went right for her.
I, on the right side of the group, shot to the right and forward across the street, into the safe zone.
Turning around, I saw only Nicole heading my direction.
I called out to her, asking how many of us made it.
When she held up two fingers, I was a bit crestfallen.
Had our whole team been decimated just like that?
A moment later, we spotted Sean across the street in the safe zone, and he rejoined us.
We didn't see Eris and Aynne for the rest of the night, though we later got an SMS that they were on the beach.
Checkpoint 2 â?? 1801 Market Street â?? It's Tops
We found Sarah enjoying dinner at the It's Tops diner.
Getting her signature on our manifests, we asked her how many people had shown up before us.
She let us know we were #s 5, 6, and 7â??only 4 players in front!
After she told us to look for a woman with a broken wrist at the next checkpoint, we thanked her and headed back outside.
Our original plan involved catching the N-Judah out through and under Twin Peaks and then catching a bus north, but we saw the chasers starting to swarm in the direction we'd need to go.
We figured that ours wasn't the only team to have suffered losses at this point, and the number of chasers was increasing, making things a lot more difficult.
After some deliberation and speculation, we decided to head north on Octavia and start cutting across and around, with the intention of making it to the station before anyone noticed us amidst the other pedestrians.
Instead, as we cut across a street, Sean spotted the bus stop on Haight Street and we waited there in safety.
Only a few minutes passed before we caught the bus up into the Upper Haight.
Along the way, another racer (Liam?
) got on the bus and joined us in the back.
He told us that a friend of his, a chaser, was also on the bus, waiting to follow him out once he got out.
This turned out to be Devin, and you can read his side of this leg of the race in his documentation.
The four of us tried to look inconspicuous and considered our options.
We told Liam that our plan was to get out at Masonic and take the bus north from there to Geary.
Liam was going to go with us, but then he said he was going to get off early to pull Devin off the bus, confident he could outrun and get around him.
He did so somewhere in the Haight, calling out to Devin and getting out the back.
Devin, reading his book, didn't get out in time and ended up getting out at the next stop, never noticing we were there.
At Masonic, we waited again, and discussed that the waiting was slowing us down and would continue to do so.
I pointed out that there wasn't going to be a magic bus anywhere along the route that could get us there without having to transfer, and since we also lost two of our team, there was no bonus points to be had at this point, and that staying alive was more important.
It's just the nature of the game.
The bus came, we took it to Geary, and took the Geary bus right into the safe zone across the street from the third checkpoint.
On the Geary bus we ran into Lars, Jenny and some others I didn't recognize.
When we got out, everyone seemed to be heading down the street.
in the wrong direction, I saw, when I checked the street signs.
(When looking for 2807, 2900â?? means reverse!
) We stopped Sean from going that way, and everyone else was already across the street and out of the safe zone, but.
this was a race.
We took off wordlessly up Geary in the other direction, and jaywalked across the street.
Checkpoint 3 â?? 2807 Geary Boulevard â?? Family Billiards
2807 Geary turned out to be a pool hall.
The nicest pool hall that I've been in, really.
We went in and found Ian's sister Alison sitting with a friend.
We knew her from the cast on her left arm, and we got our signatures right away.
Everyone else from the bus started spilling in after our team was squared away, and as she was signing, I asked Alison how many had been here before us.
Only two, it turned out!
We suspected that it was Kelly and Vlad, but I'm thinking now that she meant two teams.
Still, we thought we were doing great.
But it seemed like everyone who hadn't caught the chaser virus was right there with us, so we got out fast.
I got a couple photos before we did, which prompted someone up front to get on the PA and remind everyone that flash photography was not allowed in the pool hall.
Outside, another chaser was already circling, and so we kept to the safe zone and went back to the bus stop we arrived at.
A couple other players joined us, I think, and another Geary bus came soon.
On it, we met up again with Ian's parents.
Discussing the race (\Shoot
Our conversation was cut short when we got to 6th Avenue, where our team got out and went across the street to catch the 44 into Golden Gate Park.
The 44 bus went right by one end of Middle Drive E, which was considered a safe zone, and we were hoping we could get out right there, but the only stop in the park was by the de Young Museum.
two streets away.
The park was probably the hardest part in the race.
It was already night when we got to the pool hall, you couldn't see a chaser's purple ribbon until it was probably too late.
talk about paranoia.
We walked down the street we were on, thinking we'd stick to the trees as we headed towards Middle Drive E, but we spotted someone walking down Martin Luther King drive and, when he saw us, he never looked away and started texting someone on his phone.
Right into the trees we went.
We ended up in a parking lot, open and vulnerable, but we had no choice to keep going and get across the street at the other end.
We did so without incident, fortunately, the chaser not having circled around to follow us.
One more block to go, and Sean thought we could cut across the construction going on, and I was game to try but wasn't sure.
We ended up going right by and around it, ending up at the entrance to the Shakespeare Garden.
It was closed by a big iron gate, but it wasn't locked, so Sean led the way.
As I was going in, Nicole and I suddenly heard a voice from across the path.
\Do you mind shutting the gate behind you?'
We couldn't see anyone there, but it sounded like someone was sleeping on the ground across the path.
\Sorry
\'S alright
Sean had got ahead of Nicole and I as that conversation transpired, so Nicole and I made our way through the garden to the brick monument at the other end.
Sean had gone around it, but we couldn't see how or where.
I started to go around one way and Nicole the other, when on the other side I saw a silhouette walking right towards me.
Fuck, again.
Sean or chaser?
The silhouette just stood there.
I was tensing up to bolt.
\ I asked
Jason
Going up the road, Sean found a park map that showed the hidden path (well, hidden in the dark) going up to the circle.
Up a rise and down some stairs, we saw an orange safety cone with a light inside, making it glow, sitting in the middle of a circular opening.
Ian and Evan were there, Evan with a broom.
As Evan signed our manifests, Ian told me he was rooting for our team, really glad that we had made it this far.
We also learned that six people had been here before us, but that some of them were doing the checkpoints in a different order.
I thought that, while clever, it was cheap, probably cheating, and said so.
Ian, in his way, neither confirmed nor denied the legality of such an action.
After some planning of alternate routes, since getting back to the de Young seemed unlikely, Ian warned us that several chasers had been spotted going up and down MLK Drive, and we might want to consider going another way.
We got our streets mixed up (or at least I did) and thought that MLK Drive was the long street to the north, where the Conservatory of Flowers was.
Instead, it was the street where we spotted the chasers from before.
Still, thinking we'd have to exit the other side of the park and get back across elsewhere, we headed out the other side of the circle after getting our next contact (a man with a box of logs), up some stairs, through some trees, across the baseball fields and to Lincoln Avenue, running along the south side of the park.
We walked along the park, as I took the lead and kept an eye out for chasers waiting to jump out at us, but we made it to 9th Avenue and the bus stop for the 44 going north.
Once again, we discussed that bus transfers were killing our time.
I was really paranoid about the number of chasers along the course at this point, and thought best to err on the side of caution.
Nicole was with me, but I think Sean was getting impatient and wanted to take more risks.
I was with the occasional risk, but we had to pick our battles wisely.
In the meantime, the 44 could get us right to Balboa Street, and the Balboa bus could get us right to the fifth safe zone.
Sean agreed and we waited.
And waited.
Nicole pointed out that it was 10:30pm and that the chasers would be called in at 10:45.
Had it really been that long since we started?
I called Ian and told him we were worried about the race ending.
He told us that there would still be chasers out after 10:45 and that we should consider ourselves in play until we reached the beach.
That made me feel better and I let the others know the good news.
I mean, I didn't think we'd get to the beach first at this point, but I didn't want us to be timed-out and disqualified because the busses were slow.
The 44 finally came around 10:40pm and we took it north through the park.
We ended up talking to another guy on his way home, who said he'd help us get to where we were going after I showed him our map and told him we were racing across the city.
But as we got to Fulton Avenue, Sean went to the front of the bus, looked out the side, and motioned for us to get out there.
He was out before we could say anything, and so Nicole and I jumped out the back.
What's going on, what happened to Balboa?
\
 we can grab that.'
\
 the chasers will probably be looking for us that way
If we took the Balboa bus, we'd get in to the safe point without having to deal with them.
\
 and we decided on Balboa before the Fulton bus showed up.'
(I said something like \If we get caught
) The walk to Balboa was uneventful, and we found a bench (a real bench, not the flip-down half-seats other bus stops have) to take a breather on.
Sean seemed okay with this plan when he found out the Balboa bus runs every 15 minutes, so we wouldn't lose too much time.
I made an audio recording on my camera of our situation while we waited, during which an SUV came up and asked directions to the Golden Gate Bridge.
We didn't have to wait too long before the bus arrived, and we found the guy we were talking to on the 44, who said something like, \See?'
Checkpoint 5 â?? 1640 Balboa Street â?? Laundromat
A small laundromat was at the address of the fifth stop.
Orion was there, manning the spot, and we also were reunited with Vlad, Kelly and Avidd.
I was glad to see all of them, until Avidd turned around and we saw that he had a purple ribbon tied around the flower on his jacket.
Orion signed our manifests as the rest of them left, and said, \And before you go
\You're kidding me
\We have to carry a log the rest of the way?'
\How do you think the wood for the fire is going to get to the beach?'
We're tired, and just as we thought the end was in sight, we had to carry extra weight with us.
Sean got a log as well and we left the laundromat.
Outside, Kelly, Vlad, Avidd, and some other guy who was not Maccabee but would later claim to be Maccabee's avatar wanted to know if he could go with us.
He wasn't a chaser, after all.
Avidd warned us that chasers in some sort of yellow buggy had been seen zipping up and down 18th Avenue and that we should be careful, before he slipped off up to 17th to see if he could catch anyone else, leaving us to discuss what we were going to do.
With Avidd's back turned and up the block a bit, we ended up running down to the bus stop at 19th Avenue.
Much deliberation as to what we were doing.
Kelly admitted that they had seen us at other bus stops before this, but weren't sure if we had been turned into chasers or not and they had avoided us totally.
I brought up that bus stops were safe zones, and there was some deliberation as to whether or not \MUNI stations\' (as it said on our manifest) included bus stops
Kelly and Vlad had been playing the whole game assuming bus stops weren't safe, which is pretty impressive that they'd made it as far as they had.
I pointed out that it'd be terribly unfair if you couldn't even wait for a bus in peace in this game.
Avidd returned shortly thereafter to circle like a shark.
At some point, Sean, Vlad and Kelly all decided to run for it, and Avidd took off after them.
Nicole and I figured we'd wait for the bus, get out somewhere in the 30s where there probably weren't any chasers (since the Balboa bus would only get us two blocks from Great Highway, and we figured that'd be some sort of chaser gauntlet at this pointâ??screw that), get on the 18 bus which would drop us off on the west side of Great Highway, right into safety and the beach.
After a few minutes, Kelly and Vlad returned.
We told them our plan since they were still a whole team and I really wanted them to have a shot at winning.
It turned out Vlad had the same idea at some point.
Avidd showed up again as well, apparently having lost Sean (who later sent me an SMS saying he was on Geary and going to take that bus).
Some more conversation, and Ian showed up on his bike, on his way to visit Orion.
More discussion, and finally the Balboa bus showed up.
Everyone but Ian had every intention to get on that bus, but it passed on by without really slowing down.
Not much to do about that, so Ian went off to visit Orion, and Avidd took off his chaser ribbon, claiming a truce since he just wanted to get to the beach.
We all walked up to Geary (no sign of Sean, but we saw a Geary bus pass us by from half a block away) and waited for the bus there.
And waited.
And Kelly was like, fuck it, and stuck out her thumb.
They got a BMW to stop for them and she and Vlad jumped into the back seat.
I debated Nicole and I joining them but we didn't.
After they took off, the rest of us discussed the legality/creativity around that action (mostly: damn, wish we'd gone with it), and Avidd ended up taking off on foot, maybe to find a cab.
Nicole and I decided to stick to the rules and wait for a bus.
And wait we did, for like half an hour.
I was sullen and cranky, wishing the race had started an hour or two earlier so players wouldn't have to deal with crappy late-night bus schedules.
Then again, that's just part of the race.
Even past that, we were worried about how we'd get back to my car, all the way on the other side of the city, when the busses stopped running.
The Geary bus dropped us off a block from Great Highway.
We went cautiously but directly through a plaza, saw no chasers (mind, it's about 12:20am at this point), and got across to safety.
A couple calls and we knew which fire out of a long string of maybe two dozen fires to go to, and being one of the last to arrive, we added our logs.
Fucking finally.
Reunited with everyone, we fell into many discussions, including the nature of EquivalenZ tasks and how they might seem to have a higher barrier to entry than other teams, and what could be done to fix that.
Nicole took a cab back to her place on her own, and later I ended up catching a cab with Rubin, Nicole and their friend Josh back downtown around 3.
On the way back, we passed a motorcycle with twenty-eleven headlights and mirrors, like something out of Quadrophenia, and I watched the rows and rows of houses go by my window, watching us cover in 20 minutes the same ground we had raced and been pursued across for over four hours.
And to be honest, fell in love with the city all over, once again.
And I don't think anyone noticed that the map we received put San Francisco on the Atlantic Ocean.
We move whole cities here at SF0.
This was the first task that exposed me to the abilities of karitas citas, and the struggle to be 100% karitas Citas.
Given that i was notified of such a task, and such a game, the Friday before, (4/16) this was quite the test, and quite the eye-opener!
Ready, Set, Run!
i arrived within two minutes of the start of the chase, my team members, Alex and Celso, had arrived earlier, and secured our supplies.
Supplies: 
1 Chicago Map
3 Cg0 Agent maps
3 Blue Bands 
1 Audio Proof Documentation Tool (my phone)
1 Photo Proof Documentation Tool (Alex's Camera)
1 Waterbottle
3 CTA Cards
3 communication devices (in case team chacho gets split up) 
Then it was time, we ran south east into the streets of Chicago, following people through sides of houses, and alleys, realizing that we needed to be more strategic, and less herculean, we decided to keep from taking the large streets.
Site One: Stripes, and Cupcakes!
the first site was located on the other side of a highway, with agents wearing stripes and bakers hats.
luckily our strategy worked, and we didn't meet any chasers on our way to the safezone of the first site, which was located at this great run-down restaurant id like to call 'Slow Down'.
at Site one we acquired another team member, Suma, who was lost to the night when chasers found her original team and split them up, many of them jumping a fence, leaving suma to take another path.
we gladly accepted her, and moved onto the next site.
not before alex finished his cupcakes, of course.
i was sure they were laced with trickery so the chasers could find us, so i declined the cupcakes.
Site Two: Tea Party at the Underpass
 Site Two was located further south east along 90-94, and we were smart to keep from the other teams that had made it to site one in similar time to ours.
knowing that there were chasers lurking along the end of the safezone.
we chose to take hidden routes, behind factories, and apartment complexes.
eventually leading to Chicago Ave, the only bridge that would take us to halstead.
we attempted to make it onto the busy road, only to see a chaser, and ran toward a condo complex, unsure of whether it would be a dead end cul-de-sak or not, and determined to flee from the chasers.
and it only got creepier as the near catholic church tolled the time.
so we made it to chicago street, and found green street, watching our backs as regular chicagoans made their way to theaters and restaurants in the area.
and as we walked over the bridge towards the intersection of halstead, grand, and milwaukee, we noticed another group walk closer to the blue line, and they stopped to talk to someone.
who ended up being A CHASER!
we ran down the other block, away from the groups of blue bands, trying to find refuge behind trashcans and doorways, until we knew we were safe.
then we were only a block away from the safezone, and site 2.
we had to duck behind a row of cars on a dark street, and then jet to safety on Hubbard, dodging the looks of two unsuspecting chasers.
when we got to site two, i was exhausted, but accomplished!

Site Three: The Lower Level
 knowing what was lurking in the area, we were very careful to head as swiftly as possible to the blue line stop.
after a heated discussion as to where we will get off,  between me and celso, we decided that we would take the blue line to Monroe, and walk the distance back towards site 3.
it was a very easy walk, and noticed not many people had taken our route, so it seemed to ease our position, and rather enjoyed the view of state street, and decided to stop for a mini break at a friends bar, (hoping that he would get us a good luck round.
but we were unsuccessful) we got a few tips on the best ways to get to the lower level, and headed on our way.
the first flight of stairs we saw across the street, on the east side of michigan avenue, we took.
proof:id49960, size:100, align:left
but quickly realized there were chasers too close by to continue, and ran back up the stairs!
we hid behind columns at a nearby building, until we could muster the strength to try again.
success!
no Chasers!
but this area was creepy anyway.
we got tips from the local people that im sure knew the area much more intimately than any of us could imagine.
so we stayed close to the corners, and crept our way to the chicago river.
(it was beautiful!
)
then SHUUSSHHH!
another chaser!
so we ran to the next block, only to be met by a Michigan Ave sign.
werent we On Michigan ave?
we asked a man crossing the street.
he starts pointing back in the direction we came in.
we passed it!
so we went back, behind trash cans, and as quietly as possible.
till we made it to the Billy Goat Tavern.
where we had seen a chaser.
and who might this chaser be?
our new friend Suma's buddy from the split up group!
The agents tell us the last site has been moved, and theres a great after party.
(we were all looking forward to that!
) 
Site 4: A Girl, A Boy, and Cardboard
so after a quick chat with and pardon from the chaser /slash friend, we were off to the 4th site, going the way we came.
looking back every other step.
cause even friends cannot be trusted in this game!
and just before we went back up the stairs, there it was!
MaChensey!
the street holding bonus site 2.
we knew we wouldnt be able to have another chance like that, so we darted back to MaChensey street, searching in the darkness of the alley-street for a stamp.
then we found it!
so up the stairs we went, back onto michigan ave.
and we were met by a few other groups who decided to walk with us to site 4.
and thats when my foot tingling rose to a foot pricking pain.
but as my high spirits dragged my foot along.
Â  i tried my best to keep up with the group.
we walked back down state street.
feeling safe with all the red line stops along the way.
and even stopped to pose for a group picture in front of the Chicago Theater.
and as we walked down washington st we noticed a few more groups straggling a block behind us.
then reaching the end of the block, and turning onto clark we notice the groups behind us rushing towards us.
ANOTHER CHASER!
we run to the nearest blue line stop for safety, then wonder, why the groups were running?
we hadnt seen the chaser yet, and the groups had slowed down.
then turning the corner comes a young lady with a grey sweater.
and TWO RED STRIPES on each side of her sleeves!
she was a regular citizen, scaring all us blue-bands away!
we had to get a picture with her.
she couldnt figure out this whole time why so many people around her were running away!
we got a real laugh out of that.
and headed on our way two locks further to make it to site 4!
when we arrived, a cop watched as we hustled our way to the massive white cardboard mountain, as a boy and a girl lay homage.
chanting ' two girls, one dress' and 'sprite'.
i noticed some of the chanted words were written on the mountain.
and players were able to write them, so i was real confused what clues were real, and what were created by the players hands.
but more importantly.
my foot was screaming!
i asked my team if i could sit down for a bit.
and decide.
is this game worth my foot?
we decided that we could stop by a walgreens, or CVS to get me some kind of wrap for my foot so we could continue on to site 5, located on canal and roosevelt.
and the best way to get there would be the blue line.
so we skipped on down to wait for the train.
and lo N Behold.
a chaser had the same idea as we.
so we made friends.
but we all knew that the goal of site 6 was still above all.
and i knew i was the easy target with my throbbing ankle.
proof:id49961, size:100, align:left

after confusing other groups waiting for the blue line.
and almost getting on the wrong train.
WITH the CHASER.
we jumped onto the Blueline towards Clark and Lake.
SEEMINGLY in the wrong direction.
we noticed we had company too.
the Chaser had come onto the train with us.
only onto the car down from ours.
we FREAKED!
how would we get away from the hunting chaser?
we thought we were finished, when the train car curved.
and we noticed that the train car was in a different angle than ours.
we ran through the emergency doors to the next car, and slowly and carefully got off at clark and lake.
waiting to see if the chaser had followed.
SUCCESS!
no chaser!
so at this point.
the hobbling commenced, and we were taking the handicap elevators to the Loop trains.
we got onto the orange line, headed for roosevelt, with a sense of real accomplishment.
we were on our way to the site before last, as blue bands, and knew we had made it further than most.
then down the stairs to our doom.
as we walk out of the roosevelt stop, here come a group of chasers!
we freeze, but they call out: dont worry, we're already done!
still a scary site to see for how far weve come.
they say theyre going to go celebrate with some beers, so we congratulate them, and introduce ourselves.
Out Comes An In-Game Chaser!
from the roosevelt stop we just left.
i creep back inside.
knowing that although we are in a safezone now.
this could be it.
he could just wait there till we accept our failure.
but then he turns, and makes his way down the street to the walgreens.
we Take Our Chance, as i skip my way across Roosevelt to the 24hr Jewel for ankle supplies!
we didnt notice any suspicious characters in the store.
only people who just needed a few things here and there from the area.
and it almost seemed like another day.
when
at the check out we spot the same chaser coming through the door!
(This moment will forever replay in my mind and haunt my dreams)
i say.
hey guys.
that one chaser is right there.
 and as my team just realizes what i say.
YOURE CAUGHT!
the Chaser Leaped onto us, tagging alex and celso.
and then suma.
i didnt even see you there!
hand it over.
what a horrible way to get caught!
all i could think was.
WHY DIDNT I SCREAM RUN!
just another night.
causing paranoia and distress amongst the hordes out on a lovely Saturday eve in the Chi (and getting plenty of it too if this makes them feel any better).
didn't mean for this to happen, didn't expect it, didn't really think about it - so for it, i apologize.
buying water on state and 22nd so i could make change for the bus (yes, i realized i had only 50 cents on my CTA card when the night's activities began) a man confronted me while i waited for the cashier to finish taking a phone order, waiting and rolling eyes with other customers who salivate as they eye the relatively fresh pizza slices through the glass displaycase.
he didn't want a dollar for his brokedown car like the previous guy.
screwtop soda bottle in hand, he tells me he has a piss test to take and asks if i would mind helping him out.
i politely decline.

The Stats: Team Fuck Yeah started with 4 people and finished with 4 people.
We never split up or went separate ways.
We got all 4 of our members through all 6 checkpoints and 3 bonus checkpoints.
We earned yellow ribbons, and our team finished with all 4 blue ribbons and all 4 yellow ribbons.
No member of our team needed or used a resurrection ribbon.
We used feet, busses, tunnels, and trains.
The Robbery!
One of the awards was for Team Unity.
This awarded was granted to a team that was not ours.
That team started with 6 members and finished with 5.
There are reasons that they deserve the award, but there are some equally compelling reasons that in fact, Team Fuck Yeah actually deserved the Team Unity Award.
There was no chance to put it to the crowd or have the two teams present their respective strengths and weaknesses.
In light of the robbery of our award Team Fuck Yeah was forced to temporarily change their name to Team Oh, Hell No!
However, Team Fuck yeah was mostly kidding around about our outrage.
We know we ruled, and we donâ??t need no stinking awards to tell us so!
The Moments: The first bonus checkpoint was the hardest of all things!
The star on the map didnâ??t really correspond to the location of the stamp, so we spent a pretty long and eventually frustrating time searching for the stamp.
We ran into multiple other players also searching futiley.
Thank goodness Danarchy located it and shared the location.
While we strategized and waited for the bus we had the chance to tell multiple other frustrated players the location as well.
This was our most stressful time because we almost didnâ??t make it to checkpoint 1 on time!
The third bonus checkpoint was at the top of a hill in Gold Medal Flour park.
If youâ??ve never been there, you should totally go.
Itâ??s really pretty and awesome, and I live in MPLS and had never been there.
It was also quite squishy due to earlier rain.
My feet squelched with every step.
Team Fuck Yeah was approaching, and we saw two figures at the top of the hill.
Spacebug and R.
C4ndy grabbed hands, prepared to make out and fool any chasers into thinking they were simply young lovers out for a midnight stroll.
Daxâ??s team was approaching at the same time.
So, basically, there were 9 people â??sneakingâ?? up this hill towards the two people, ready to run at any second.
But it turned out they were just a couple people making out.
Shockingly, they decided to leave.
Oliver was a chaser at checkpoint 3.
As we were approaching we saw his red/orange  head start coming towards us.
We booked ass through a parking garage and snuck around the block, then ran super-duper fast to the safe zone, which included a train station.
We decided to wait for a train, and then run for a bus.
Shortly before the train came Oliver joined us at the train stop and said he was going to take a train with us.
We strategized to get in a different car, or to take off running the second the train stopped.
We hesitated to get on and then jumped on just as the doors were closing.
Oliver was right behind us, with his face up against the glass of the closing doors when R.
C4ndy turned around and yelled â??SUCKERâ?.
Which led to the whole train being like â??yeah!
â? Oliver said he wasnâ??t actually going to take the train, he was just trying to spook us.
It didnâ??t spook us, but it did lead to an excellent interaction with the public on the train, and they got really into the game.
We ended up getting off on Nicollet because thatâ??s where everyone on the train was getting off and it offered good cover.
The SpyHouse coffee shop was checkpoint 5.
We did an excellent job sneaking up on it, including going between apartment buildings and down alleys.
The SpyHoue was awash in chasers, the most heavily guarded area that we experienced.
(Hard Times was more heavily guarded, but we were pretty lucky there).
We wanted to catch the bus that ran right in front of the coffee shop, but bus stops were only safe zones for 15 seconds, during boarding, and only then if there was a shelter.
C4ndy attempted to enlist the aid of a man that was very interested in telling her about how sweaty he was.
All she wanted was for him to stop the bus across the street, then we would book-ass straight onto it, but that was faaaaaar too confusing for him.
Plus, the chasers arranged themselves in front of the bus stop and in the street on the way, so it looked hopeless.
When the chasers tore off down the street after some incoming players we tried to duck out the side door, but there was a player yelling frantically to get back inside, so we did.
Except S4, who was in the alley, and couldnâ??t get back.
He headed down the street to the Bad Waitress.
C4ndy contacted the SpyHouse staff and got permission to use the service entrance and Team Fuck Yeah plus 1 (whoâ??s name I never did catch) snuck out the back and over to the bad waitress to reclaim S4.
There was obviously much more to the entire quest, but those are the highlights.
Using public transit was great because it got so many more people involved.
On every bus and train we took people really liked hearing about it.
Lots of people worked in bars and suggested that we use their bars as checkpoints in the future.
Team Fuck Yeah meant to take shots along the way, but sadly forgot the plan in the midst of running and sneaking.
Personal Stories
R.
C4ndy: 
The bad: I had a couple of interactions with organizers and players that made feel personally not welcome.
I also thought that the resurrection thing was a little too much.
By going to bonus checkpoints you could earn an extra life, and thatâ??s cool because you are working for it.
But the resurrections were these endless extra-lives and it seemed like every other person was resurrected.
On the bus we met a guy whoâ??s been resurrected twice!
The Great!
This was my first Journey and I really really loved it.
I loved interacting with the public, I loved traversing the city, and sneaking through back-ways, I loved competing- but in a friendly way.
This was also one of my first big fun things since the break-up and I remembered how great it is to chat with new people and flirt with boys (ummmâ?¦19 really is too young though) and only be responsible for my own fun.
I liked running, and I wanted to finish strong, but I was also sort of disappointed not to get to chase, because it looked so fun and I had all these ideas about where to lurk and set up ambushes.
I am excited to play in a city that isnâ??t my own!
I would like to work on the next Journey in MPLS (provided I still live here) and be a chaser for that game.
S4
As it rained earlier that day, I wore a coat and then regretted it the entire night.
Cool damp is great running weather.
The damn thing ended up tied around my bag the whole night.
We got to see some really interesting parts of the city.
My favorite new place was Gold Medal Park, a bonus checkpoint, with its blue lit park benches and spiral Grassy Gnoll.
When we got there with Dax's team, we could see the silhouettes of a couple standing on one of the benches at the peak of the gnoll.
It was impossible to tell whether they were chasers or not.
We had no choice but to go up anyway.
Turns out they were on a date.
I loved planning our approach to any given checkpoint.
We tried to take the almost direct route whenever possible.
Like the alley, or the Tunnels, or the parking lots, or a parking ramp.
Though we never encountered a chaser en-route, it was still fun to stew in a certain level of paranoia.
My biggest dissapointment was the final checkpoint.
Spacebug
I wasn't sure I was going to make it to Journey at all, as I'd been travelling all weekend, my plane landed just before the meetup time, and I wasn't sure I'd be Up For It.
I'm so glad I came, 'cause it was super fun!
Since I hadn't know if I was going to come at all, I hadn't thought at all about logistics- I didn't have a team, I didn't have a plan, I didn't have bus fare, I was just gonna roll with it.
C4ndy, besides being a favorite, tempted teaminess by saying she had a brilliant plan to start, but that I couldn't know what it was until I agreed to team up.
Worked for me!
Thus, Operation Bonus Checkpoint First got us started off.
I'm excited that our whole team made it to the end all together all the way through it would have made me sad for Team Fuck Yeah to get separated.
Highlights for me.
I'd never taken the minneapolis light rail because it never went anywhere I did, so finally getting to be a passenger there was fun.
It also means I had traveled on a plane, several busses, on foot, and on trains all in one day!
I also really enjoyed the hot tub at the after party.
It was my idea to take the sneaky shortcut on a lonely road along the river.
But that same road brought us right into the center of dozens of Chasers prowling along Canal Street.
After we crossed the tracks, an Amtrak train slowly backed over the crossing, blocking off our escape route.
And then the Chasers came.
I made it past one, but another came around the corner.
Two of my friends escaped into the darkness around some parked trailers, b ut Emily and I got caught disappointingly quickly.
It was a bummer after all that scheming in the early part of the game!
To go down with hardly a fight.
But the street was solid pink territory.
We passed hungry Chasers all interested in winning ribbons, with not enough prey to go around.
At last a lone runner appeared sneaking along the cars on Canalport.
We thought we had him cornered in a fenced in parking lot, but he hopped the 5-foot fence and tore across the street behind some garages, where I poked around but didn't see his shadow escape until he was too far away to catch.
From there we roamed through desolate streets toward the bridge to Chinatown where we ran into Nathan again.
We watched from a distance as a busload of Runners exited the Cermak bus, ran around an empty lot in a panic and back onto the same bus.
Must have been some Chasers hiding in the bushes waiting for them.
After bubble teas and waiting around in Chinatown, we all headed toward home.
Nathan caught a few runners escaping the safety of the plaza, but I was sad the fun was over and I hadn't caught anyone.
But walking toward Pilsen I spotted a couple with thin blue ribbons far away on the other side of the street.
For several blocks we had a slow motion pursuit, waiting for walk signals at stoplights, pretending that none of us noticed each other.
Crossing at the crosswalk I was nearly on them when we all broke into a run.
Suddenly the girl wheeled around and was squirting something at me.
It was enough to confuse me and almost slow me down, but instead of taking off, the girl turned to aim the mustard bottle with obvious relish.
It was easy enough to tag her, but my clothes and face were splattered.
I chased her friend down the block but turning back to the mustard girl she was gone.
So I had to track her and chase her again a block away.
\Please can I keep my blue ribbon?'
\Let's pretend this never happened!'
Its a drag to get caught.
But after that you get to chase people!
I am making this text aren't I?
Mood: Paranoid, I'll be happy if we make it to the first checkpoint without getting caught!
After we were released at the ferry building, Meredith and I ran down into a BART station to look at the bus maps, because we are silly and clueless like that, and are, more specifically, city-and-bus-ignorant.
There was this one beachlady at the MUNI counter who told us to walk to some store to buy a map, but we promptly ignored her and went to the other MUNI counter and planned bus routes with a red pen thing we borrowed from the ocunter.
This was antsy-making, but very worth it, in the end.
But, at the time, this put is Behind The Herd.
As we walked down Market, we discovered that we have no sense of proportion, and one block actually felt like forever to walk.
Additionally, we did this thing where we kept looking over our shoulders for people, and we kept crossing the street whenever we saw other people period, so that was quite fun and racist, probably.
OH MY GOD THERE'S A WHITE MALE AGE 30SOMETHING, WE MUST FLEE.
We got to the first checkpoint after a very long, meandering journey through the city, and up long flights of stairswhichwereARG because neither of us knew what Coit tower looked like.
(we would have followed the signs, but we were pretty bad at orienting ourselves.
Don't look at us like that!
)
The view from there was superpretty, as it was sunset, and we could basically see the whole city from where we were, and we would have stayed up there longer, but uh.
at any rate, and we got little cups of water and coca cola from the GM's mom and dad (Amused) and made them sign our slip.
They said they were about to leave, so, evidently, we were Very Behind.
We then trundled down through Chinatown, and that was fairly quiet as well.
Highlights would include this really fast moving hobo that looked like a dementor or one of those enemies in Valkyrie profile, with the billowing cloaks and everything.
We thought he might be a chaser or something so we pointedly crossed the street and were horrified when he crossed to the other side but still managed to keep up with us.
We lost track of him eventually, and saw this other person behind a pole.
We ran away and went up a few side streets to avoid him.
We eventually got to the next checkpoint, and it was fairly uneventful.
We then went to this place on Nob Hill or something called CALA foods and that was fairly terrifying because we saw bunches of chasers talking and being chatty with other players in the parking lot and yeahhhhh.
The sudden realization that we were sort of in the middle of everyone else rather than far behind was pretty OMG!
but since we were already Fairly Paranoid this didn't affect us so much.
We got the Morton salt girl to sign our thing and then we boogied the hell out of there as quickly as we could.
I trusted Meredith to orient us, and this wasn't an awful choice, but.
About two blocks away from the store, I looked behind us and saw something, and said to Meredith, 'I THINK I SEE A TRAINSTOP BEHIND US' (That was our code word for ohnertz run away) and when we started hearing the thump thump thump of running feet we were all 'AAAAAAH' and headrushes!
and insanity!
and runninglikeacrazyperson!
ensued for three blocks while some balding-30-something-white-male (I didn't bother to look back over my shoulder, this is what Meredith tells me) chased us.
Meredith crossed the street a few times, almost running into oncoming traffic, and I just dove into a liquor store.
Eventually she evaded the person, and I was busy spouting apologies to the liquor store owner because he screamed at me 'GET AWAY FROM THE WINE!
' Because I was in sort of a precarious spot.
He also said things such as 'HE'S IN HERE!
' or 'WE SHOULD KICK HIM OUT!
' but generally I was unperturbed and continued spouting out my apologies until I decided that I should call Meredith.
She was hiding in another liquor store across the street, having hidden behind a car for a while (that tricky girl!
We continued on our way, deciding that perhaps it was time to take a bus to the next stop, as not only were my feet killing me, but we'd also get out from the middle of the herd.
Of course, this ended up being a poor idea.
We got on the bus that went straight to where we wanted to go, but these other players came on, and they were all like 'We're cool, we have these cheat buttons because we found this creepy guy who was giving them out!
' (He was part of the game too) and it was kind of Arg.
Then this large group of some 6 chasers got on on the stop which we should have gotten off of, and I was like 'Maybe we should get off' but we were kind of paralyzed.
We went a few more stops, and more chasers got on, and we decided to make a break for it even though it was kind of nowhere near where we were supposed to be.
Someone tagged me but then I pointed to the bus stop and said 'BUS STOP!
' or something far less dramatic and that was the end of that.
Oh, have I mentioned that we were both fairly traumatized by this point?
Well, we were, I was all jittery and incoherent and AAAH!
and Meredith was very proud of herself but also kind of AAAH!
We were in Japantown, at this point, and well, we dove up a few side streets that were very dark and tied our shoes in some alleyway because that was the totally intelligent smart thing to do.
We kept crossing the street whenever we saw people running about and yeah.
We didn't pay attention to the address marked on our map so we just went into the Japantown center and had foreign sodas which were really awesome (mine had chunks of mango in it!
) at this little cafe that was open late.
It was a very cool pit stop, and there were bathrooms, so that was nice too, as our bladders were fairly full.
We went to the Denny's across the street, and at that point Meredith said to the guy 'You were hard to find!
' and the person who was there was all like 'Is there anyone else behind you?
' implying something similar to 'You're late, buttfaces.
' except in an amusing accent.
Japantown was my favorite part of the trip.
Uh, yeah, then we took a bus to some person's house, and the stupid bus kept not coming, so we waited forever but eventually caught it and yeah.
It was basically the little apartment from heaven, because we were invited in and offered things like bathrooms and drinks and such and it was so incredibly pretty and sophisticated.
The lady there then asked us to write down directions to the Space Needle (we're not sure why, but I know I wrote something about traveling through the eye then impaling one's self and then going to space) and it was nice.
We then wandered around in the dark because the bus never came, and we caught the 43 to the Presidio.
Meredith and I didn't really understand what the Presidio was, but I did remember that there had been shootings there, or something.
As we rode the bus we noted that it was the large, forested area.
We then remarked that sf0 is making us do some pretty.
hardcore stuff.
Who the hell would run through the forest past midnight?
I swear, does nobody have no grasp of werewolf-maulings?
Anyway, we got off at some random stop, and the bus driver was no help at all, so we ended up being lost somewhere in the Presidio.
We wandered around for a little while, chasers appeared behind us, Meredith ran, the person behind me ran, and I thought to myself 'MAYBE THEY WON'T CATCH ME IF I DON'T RUN.
' Of course, this was an idiotic idea, but then again, I didn't have much run left in me anyway, so that was the end of that.
Meredith made it to a bus stop that was like, 20 feet away.
I then said to Meredith, relieved, 'YES!
Now all I have to worry about is rapists and gunmen.
' And I really shouldn't have been that relieved, but I was.
We then stole the map from our chasers, and looked for the next checkpoint which was something called 'Lover's Lane' which is actually just some ickypath in the middle of nowhere.
There were these flickering lights that were terrifying, and I wasn't kidding when I said it was a ickypath.
It was literally a dirt path that ducked downwards into the woods.
After wandering around in the dark for a while in the woods we decided that this was far too sketch and that we'd just go to the last checkpoint and die, quite possibly, in some cult sacrifice (in the end there turned out to be no sacrifice).
It was hideously far away on this marina thing which was basically, like, uh, a peninsula that was so incredibly long and dreadful.
We made it, though, after we met up with a few other people who evidently were the people that were at checkpoint #6 and who seemed to have phone numbers they could call in order to get us where we needed to go.
Anyway, now, whenever we go anywhere, we look over our shoulders, wherever we are, and desperately hope to God we don't see people with red ribbons.
It's kind of humorous.
First let me say that I am brand new to this site, thanks solely to the journey, and I really have no idea what I'm doing.
That said, this was certainly a crazy weekend, and I'll try to capture it without being a total doofus.
Though I make no promises.
Meeting up with everyone, you could just feel the anxious excitement all around.
People's nerves translated into smiles and laughs and the thrill of the unknown, as this is the first time it's been done in Chicago, so no one really know what exactly to expect.
Rex makes funny faces.
We met in Wicker Park and, after hearing the rules and splitting into teams, SHOT OFF and scattered, running in the direction of the first checkpoint.
I had no idea where I was going.
I just followed my team, which was large.
There were like 20 of us.
But that wouldn't be the case for long.
The group separated far faster than we all thought.
Anyway, we were runners with blue bands, and there were chasers in red bands - on bikes!
'This is not unfair,' the organizer said.
It was absolutely crazy.
At one point, Rex turned around frantically, shouting that a chaser was after Littlemonk.
We ran across the street, and I suggested we hide in a sunken porch that was obstructed by trash cans.
He was hesitant but agreed.
It was EXACTLY LIKE TV.
The pressure to calm my heaving breathing, stop panting, and remain quiet as the bike went by almost took more effort than the sprinting.
Then we had to stealthily check where the chaser was and dart out across the street down an alley.
Other moments were seriously like an episode of 24 as we were scouting areas and the silence was broken by a blaring cell phone, ringing out like a homing beacon on our exact location.
As I said, the group separated fairly quickly.
I stuck by Rex, even though I think he wasn't too keen on me slowing him down, hah!
We made it to the first and second checkpoints, though:

We still have blue bands - success!
We met up with more of the group there, but they wanted to take the el, and we weren't 100% behind that plan, so we continued off on our own once again.
We may have taken the long, out-of-the-way route, but we got to a bonus checkpoint!
My feet were KILLING me at this point, but I trudged on.
We made it to the third checkpoint at the Billy Goat, where I tried shoving napkins in my shoes for extra padding.
In no way, shape, or form did that help, so I removed them.
I then put my GLOVES on my FEET.
Which felt better than the napkins.
We met up with more team members and started heading to checkpoint #4.
I saw a Walgreens, though, and ran in to buy some socks, telling my team I'd catch up with them after.
As I frantically searched for socks and found some perfect cushy ones apparently designed for diabetics, I realized I only had $3 and change (I only brought a bit of cash and spent it on food earlier).
Still out of breath and now in a lot of pain, I approached a kind-looking young woman and mustered up the most bizarre request she's probably gotten at a Walgreens.
'I know this is going to be the most bizarre request, but I'm doing this game where we're running all over the city, and I'm wearing gloves for socks because my socks are nearly worn through.
you don't have $2.
00 you could spare so I can buy some new ones, do you?
I told my team to run on ahead, I'm sorry, I know this is SO weird!
'
She asked what the group was, and I don't even think I told her the right name, but I showed her my manifest and thanked her profusely when she pulled the weathered Washingtons out of her purse.
'This is your good Samaritan act of the day,' I assured her, 'Thank you so much!
'
Socks and cash in hand, I turned to pay and saw Rex, Gremlin, and Littlemonk down the aisle.
They came back for me!
I was shocked and flattered and felt a strange little surge of team pride amidst the pain.
I paid, put on the socks, and we set out again.
We coupled up, walking hand-in-hand with bands in the middle to try to obstruct them from the side view (though they were still fully visible from the front and from behind).
Walking down Michigan Avenue was a great strategy, as the night was mild and the tourists plentiful.
They provided great camouflage, and we blended right in.
As we turned a corner off Michigan Ave.
to make it to a safe zone, Rex noted once again, as he did so earnestly so many times during the night, that we were entering very dangerous territory and asked if we were ready to run.
Littlemonk seemed able.
Gremlin was not so sure.
And in that moment, I knew.
If I saw a chaser, there was no way I could run.
I had to give up.
Failure makes me scrunch up my face.
(I asked Richard earlier if I should change my hair out of conspicuous pigtails.
'Can you tuck it up?
' I could, so I did.
)
I really wanted to finish.
I had wanted to prove something to myself.
But apparently I proved I can do things halfway.
and that's it.
However I also did something pretty crazy that I have never done before.
I met cool people.
I saw so much of the city.
I got a workout.
My adrenaline was pumping, and above all, I had fun.
So I do feel like I accomplished something, even if I had to quit.
And I honestly would have continued on to at least make it to the finish line, had I not been worried about a few things, including going home alone at 2 am (not fun for anyone, especially a young woman with no cash for a cab) and making my feet even worse - it's my birthday on Friday, and I could not risk not being able to dance!
Tending to my injury at home, I cut open the huge blister on the ball of my left foot, fluid pouring out.
But it's a battle scar I earned along the journey.
so it's worth it â?? as long as I stop gimping and start dancing by Friday.
I completed the journey entirely on foot, as did two of the three teams before me.
It goes to show how slow muni is on a sunday.
Hoofing it was not my plan initially, it only happened because I got impatient waiting for busses.
Additionally, I figured I could avoid chasers by taking less obvious routes.
I walked briskly to coit tower, encountering only chaser P00n along the way who was fortunately worn out from chasing other players.
At the tower I was informed that I was in (roughly) fortieth place.
I jogged down the hill, cutting through foliage to avoid chasers I saw on the streets below.
I meant to take busses to the next two checkpoints, but i kept running into checkpoints before finding good bus lines.
From now on I would jog anytime the streets were even slightly downhill.
By time I reached Cala Foods the salt girl said I was in the first wave of players.
Maybe there was something to this 'no busses' business.
I jogged down to Geary to catch the 38 cause i figured the california line would be more guarded.
I got bored waiting for the bus, so I walk/jogged all the way to Japan town (not one bus passed me).
I was seventh place.
And after walk/jogging the rest of geary to checkpoint five (again, no busses passed me), I was tied for third with, well, with the team that finished third.
So how did I end up behind them at the finish?
what was my pitfall that dropped me down to fourth?
Well, they went on to catch the 43 bus at persideo gate.
I felt going the direct route into the persideo was extremely risky.
So I jogged to arguello and trail blazed down a grassy hill near the golf course.
Good thing for my flashlight!
I wound up on some backwoods hiking trail and had to walk through a wall of brambles to reach a road.
That slowed me down plenty.
By that time I was completely disoriented, so i knocked on the door of a local who was kind enough to show me where I was on the map.
I cut through some more trees and grass and wound up in someone's back yard.
After sneaking around back onto public streets, I found Lotek's outpost.
Nobody chased me at all because, hey, what crazy fool would be coming from that direction?
Lowtek pointed me at the best route to take, but I managed to get plenty lost.
Next year I'm bringing a compass!
I would have liked to have trailblazed some more, but I had to come down to look at road signs.
That's when a pack of chasers appeared out of nowhere and ran me down.
I was exhausted, I was no match for them.
I shouted 'RUBIN HATES IT!
' and handed them the powerful object that Robbinson gave me.
That object forced the chasers to give up the chase for sixty seconds, enough time for me to make it to a bus shelter and catch my breath.
I was outside of lucas arts, so I cut through the complex.
It was a straight shot to the exploratorium, and then onward to the end of the night!
The security guards watched me cutting through their bushes but didn't say anything.
But then something terrible happened.
I was power walking on the path through the palace of fine arts slash exploratorium behind a pair of old ladys from berkely.
I was close to the end and i could feel it, so i started jogging again.
Suddenly my right calf seized up and a crippling pain shot up my side.
I limped over to a bench and started whimpering, massaging my cramped leg.
It really hurt, like being stung by a five pound hornet.
The old ladies from berkeley kept walking on by.
Within minutes I recovered enough to limp at a reasonable pace.
I caught up to the old ladies from berkeley and showed them my map.
They were no help at all.
'We're from berkeley' they said.
But I had been to the wave organ before, and got there at a quarter to eleven.
What a perfect spot for the finish line!
It was freakin' gorgeous, with water on three sides and a great view of everything.
I was happy to have placed, after all that effort.
I'm guessing the people who placed ahead of me are in way better shape, and i'm guessing they weren't still limping the next day.
I'm proud of myself for pushing my body, but I should give some credit to that homebrew energy drink at the beginning.
For a couple of months (since I became aware of this event), I wondered what exactly the event would be like.
All I had to go by was that darn poster and it didn't reveal much.
I arrived at Wicker Park around 6:53 or so and began the beginning of the end of the night.
Where was I supposed to stand or even team up with?
What were the teams?
Having not to have wanted to immerse myself in SF0 just quite yet, my first real task at hand was now on the table.
A welcoming greeting was given by the curator as the fury of speculation and clusters became more evident.
then the rules were given out.
The cameras blazed and the fountain sparkled.
I wondered how in the world the map and blue arm band that were given to me were going to shield me from those that seemed to know more than me.
I lay cautious, muddled a few questions and then read the rules.
And then stared at the map for a long while.
The horn lit and I was out like cake from the oven and frankly ran where everyone else started to run- southeast- hopped the fence and then looked for a team.
I assimilated immediately and dropped out immediately.
Luckily before reaching the first checkpoint at baker's square I flocked in formation.
and then had a tasty vegan cup cake (that had been previously promised for those that ended up at the finish line (chased or not)).
Thankfully I had cribbaged amongst two Art Institute students and somehow we evaded those damn chasers.
In between the first and the second checkpoint was where our wits were fully checked.
We had been cornered in an alley with water cauldrons blocking the only secret exit.
I climbed them anyway to only see that the secret exit was just a secret and then camped out under a semi for a couple of minutes.
Then we booked flight around the corner and glanced at the chasers from then on out.
We made it to the runway behind the rerouted sixth checkpoint about 4 hours after the game had begun with our completed manifests and rejoiced with more cupcakes and conversation of settlement, along with the other 44 manifesters.
What was buffalo hunting strategy?
What should be thought about magnetic rings?
How do you do a rested back flip?
There could only be a Runner Trophy and one Chaser Trophy.
They were awarded and those of merit, courage and valor nested in admiration.
Thanks to Dax and the SF0 crew for really relaying a great Chicago experience that I will remember for a lifetime.
Below you will find some wallpapers that tell stories of that night.
My Gonzo-style video of my Journey experience.
Click the photo to watch on Vimeo, since it was too big to upload.
Comments are always appreciated.
This is my third video, and by far the longest.
I learned quite a lot!
We are panting.
Adrenaline and fear washing over the circle of runners pinned up in the dead end.
The survivors, maybe 10 of us, are catching our breath as we look the imposing obstacle of the three story garage before us.
Out in the street, we can hear the screams unlucky runners racing from their doom.
Some of our friends are missing, they will not make it.
I imagine them turned, spawn-like raising their voices in a cry pointing out our location.
Time is short.
I put in words what we all should be thinking.
\we have to move\'.'
The swifter of us begin climbing the side of the fence, up to the second floor, and then, they hope over, to the roof.
My son, among the eager, attacks the fence which is swaying and unsteady under the weight of panicked runners.
Looking into the dark I notice the garage angles into the building next to us, a short hop to the second floor, a pull up and a shimmy.
I am on top.
As I bend over to pull my son onto the roof, I smile.
\what took you so long?'
We run away, safe.
I cannot believe how much fun I had.
The one thing I regret was not bringing water.
I probably would have lasted longer if I was more hydrated and hadn't picked the routes with the most hills!
At one point, as a chaser I ran after two players who jumped a wall with at least a 9 foot drop.
My adrenaline was going so hard I did it too without even thinking twice.
Looking back, I'm pretty sure we all looked like ninjas.
I ended up cornering one and tagging her, but the other scaled a giant wall that I was too short to get over.
Luckily my friend and I had some walkie talkies and I gave her the guys location.
She got him about a block away.
You know how at the start, they told us to remember we're not invincible?
Yeah, it's true.
It's just like being a kid.
no concept of how dangerous your actions could be.
I chased one girl across broadway.
both of us running in front of a moving bus.
I'm definately flying or driving down to L.
for the one in August.
If anyone is looking to carpool, let me know!
Also, if anyone found a little black walkie talkie between lake merritt and downtown, it's probably mine.
Luckily I lost it on the way to the final location.
Let's make this happen again.
very soon!
I played Journey Chicago as a runner in 2008 and survived to the end.
It remains one of the most memorable nights I've spent in this city.
This year, I decided to experience JTTEOTN from the other side, the darker side.
As a staff chaser, my job was clear.
Strike fear into the hearts of every runner and induce paranoia at every possible turn.
I started my fear campaign on facebook weeks before the event, taunting friends whenever possible.
I teamed up with 2 of my friends who were also staff chasers and made comic book villain costumes for us.
After meeting the rest of the chasers and talking strategy, we headed for checkpoint 2A and scouted out some great spots to hide.
I chose an area along the train tracks at the north edge of the safe zone.
There was a little path in the bushes leading up to a perfectly hidden alcove where I could see the runners going by.
The problem was, no runners were going this route.
Finally a group of 4 ran past me on the other side of the street.
It was going to take some serious running to catch up to them.
I went for it, as fast and as silently as I could.
Just as I was gaining on them, the lead runner turned around and spotted me.
They all scattered and I was too far away to catch any.
But the look on his face when saw me, running silently behind them and from out of no where was victory enough.
That route continued to be unpopular so I made my way over to another team member and we started the pack technique.
One pops out and flushes the runners right into the waiting hands of the other chaser.
It was foolproof.
The first runner I tagged was so focused on my team member, he didn't even see me until I had tagged him.
Brilliant!
We stalked that area for a while until it became crowded with our previous kills.
As I was waiting for the rest of our super villain team, I took the opportunity to get inside the runner's heads.
There was an overpass around checkpoint 2A that had a ledge that was calling my name.
I scaled to the top and struck my best villain poses: crouching, leering, daring, pointing.
The checkpoint was eerily quiet and had at least 100 people all crowded around in it.
Those that noticed me all had the same reaction.
They were first shocked, then looked around to make sure this was in fact a safe zone, then looked back with cautious bemusement.
This was my favorite part of the night.
None of the runners expected to see a chaser so prominently and obviously placed.
I let them all have a good look at me, daring them to find me out there.
Reminding them no where is safe.
avoision said this of the experience in his praxis and posted a photo:
\At the second checkpoint.'
Three of us set up the perfect ambush point in an alley and waited.
And waited.
No one came through so we headed north to Estes, which proved to be fertile hunting grounds.
The wolf pack technique really kicked into high gear here.
Staggering ourselves between dark alcoves, parked cars and bushes, we steered the runners into the gauntlet of doom.
The looks of surprise mingled with pure terror were priceless.
To be in this elaborate and obvious chaser costume, but to be absolutely invisible to them until moments before their doom was an amazing feeling.
When Estes got crowded with previous kills, we moved on to Touhy for a few final chases and then to the final checkpoint to hang out with the finishers.
Sadly, I never got the chance to chase any of my friends who were running.
It was amazing to experience JTTEOTN from both sides.
As a runner, fear dictates your every move and clouds your judgement.
As a chaser, you feed on the fear of others.
By the end of JTTEOTN 2011, that hunger was satiated.
My girlfriend and I came down to DC from New Haven, CT for Journey to the End of the Night.
I wanted her to meet my old college friends like Spidere, and to get a sense of the crazy stuff we like to do.
Unfortunately, I forgot to bring my camera, so you'll have to take my word for some of this stuff.
A few days before 
AUGH WEBSITE EAT BIG STORY
Seriously, I hit submit and everything but what you see up above disappeared.
What's up with that?
Thanks to the organizers anyway, but no way am I going to try typing all that up again.
Oh well, it's the doing that matters.
I came from work with 7 souls, Jesus, and some snacks in a bag.
Arrived, courtesy of Muni, half an hour late.
They were out of waivers, but I had waited too long for this night to give up so easily.
Luckily, in my pocket I had one of the scarves of the Dali Llama (it pays to keep an eye on the competition.
)  I tied it around my arm, figuring the bright red should cause confusion.
I would pursue runner and chaser alike across the city, acquiring souls from people willing to trade anything for survival or a better pair of legs.
The scarf was definitely too long- but you could hardly notice the scorch marks (occupational hazard).
We scattered off the starting squiggle.
I felt the ancient joy of adrenaline rise in my borrowed glands as I enjoyed the discord.
And then there was only the running.
Within a block I spotted a yellow arm band on the sidewalk, I picked it up and tied it around my other arm without stopping, holding Jesus in my teeth to free up my hands.
I did not know what I was.
I never got a map until after the event was over, didn't know the rules.
I just ran until I was among only yellows.
I asked \So am I runner or a Chaser?'
It would be fun to be pursued for once.
I smirked at the thought that anyone who cought me would be in for a few surprises, not the least of which would be Jesus full in the face.
I was carrying a pad of 'alternatives'.
Convenient escape clauses for people that decided they wanted to keep their souls.
They are quite effective, no one has successfully escaped yet.
It was easy enough to convince the mortal at each checkpoint to sign it.
The evening was a whirlwind of images.
I was tagged twice, both times while in the protection of the Golden Lady.
I suspect her of having her own kind of magic.
We never encountered a red light in her presence.
Regrettably she wouldn't give up her soul for anything.
As she pointed out she already had eternal beauty.
A man in a black cap made the tactical decisions for us.
Each checkpoint we would pick up new members, usually having lost all the old ones.
but we survived.
But then we were the one devising the tactics there was never any guarantee that they were meant to make others survive.
A bald man (yes I know I keep describing heads, but I always look there first in case there are horns) dispensed strange strategies.
One where we made a solid wall of car doors and ran through.
The rest of the group discussed what kind of music would go best with our jingling bells.
Hunter S.
Thompson gave me a free pair of sunglasses.
A cat terrorized us and made me jumpy at the sight of anyone in white face for the rest of the evening.
A sight of fallen comrades.
With orange arm bands.
\
Palindromedary
Swinging Jesus in front of me around any corners, to take out anyone who might be hiding.
Someone said: \Good thing that wasn't a nun.'
No mercy towards nuns, that's my motto.
I held my arm up in front of me demanding they showed theirs.
They weren't playing.
In the end it came down to D, a man in black cap, a man covered in arrows, Davy Crockett, and a chap with a beard.
We were heading towards the final checkpoint and I knew that my survival hinged on theirs.
I needed as much cannon fodder as possible.
I told the story of how my life was saved by rocks to motivate them.
Then the man covered in arrows said that there were two things we could do.
We could go UP or we could go DOWN.
And he knew we would make the RIGHT decision.
We were pumped, walking in the middle of the street.
I had my second wind and was swinging Jesus around my head, ready to throw him at any orange band that dared to show their arm.
And then we walked into the party, never having seen a single chaser between 6 and 7.
It would have been such an anticlimax had I not collected one of the three creators of the games' soul on my way out.
All in all a productive night.
One soul for eternal health, beauty, and youth.
One soul for the ability to really shred on an electric guitar.
One soul for enough riches to live comfortably for a lifetime.
One soul for the ability to make everyone happy.
One soul for the ability to be a great writer.
One soul for a candy bar with bacon in it.
One soul for eternal health, wealth, and success.
One soul for a better pair of lungs.
One soul for eternal wealth.
One soul for fair housing.
One soul for more time.
One soul for wealth.
One soul for knowledge.
One D, leaving behind a body that had never known such exhaustion.
An Unusual Invitation
Some months ago my friend Tam mentioned she had started organizing the next \Journey\' for Chicago.'
I'd heard a bit about the previous year's event and thought it sounded like a hell of a lot of fun.
I was drawn to the concept and liked the fact that it was non-sponsored and unsanctioned.
We were discussing the trouble she was having finding a finish line venue and other complications, including volunteers.
It was at this point I mentioned coming up from Cinti to take part.
She said I could be a chaser.
Thankfully she made no mention of a 5.
5 mile course, or I would have laughed and asked what else I could do.
Maybe hold a sign or something?
Still, I knew chasing would involve running, and being terribly out of shape resolved to start training to try and prepare myself to catch people who think running halfway across a city is a fun thing to do on a Saturday night.
Athletic types, in other words.
Which, in case I haven't made myself clear, I am not.
I did start exercising a lot more.
It didn't make me any faster, as I was to learn, but it did definitely help and of course did a lot for my own personal health and well-being.
Just one part of the impact this game would end up having on me before it was all said and done.
I Love It When A Plan Comes Together
I got on the emailing list.
Various ideas about checkpoints and stuff were knocked around.
At some point the chase team formed into our own cell and we started talking strategy.
The lead guy, Kyle, talked about how as \seed\' chasers we just needed to tag a couple-few people to get the \'infection\' started.'
We discussed forming small groups of 2-3 and having one person try to drive the runners into other chasers.
I immediately volunteered to be one of those herders, knowing that I'm not breaking any 100-yard dash records but that I am more than capable of making a spectacle of myself.
I was also following the checkpoint agents and other volunteers as they came up with their themes and was struck by the imagination and creativity this group of random people were displaying.
The chaser trophy had a damn light in it!
There were robots.
And muffins.
And all sorts of other spectacular things going on that I didn't get to witness but kept hearing about all night at the bar after the race.
But first.
MAYDAY
I left Cinti via FNORDbus and arrived in downtown Chicago around 1400 local.
Wandered around for a few but was carrying a duffel and figured I'd give my gracious hosts a call.
Just as they picked up an El train thundered overhead, completely drowning any hopes of conversation.
Welcome to the city!
While I waited for a call back I grabbed some coffee at one of the FNORD Donuts that seem to be on every 3rd corner.
Coffee down and having not heard back yet, I decided I would head to the park since the meeting was less than 2 hours away, then once I was in the area grab a bite to eat.
No sooner had I walked from the subway station to the park and started looking around than I noticed a voicemail.
Naturally Tam had called me back while I was underground and out of contact.
I headed back, dropped off my bag, and we then drove over to the park with the gear for the starting line.
Tam and I had talked about the Mayday tradition and how the previous year used the Labor Trail for part of the course.
We talked about Haymarket and the Pullman Strikes and such.
I was ready for some pandemonium in the streets!
There was a bit of pre-gaming at the park and then I joined up with a red-eyed Veritas Noir and another dude named Joe who was wearing serious-runner-type gear.
We noticed the park was filling up with runners and decided to head on out and find a good area to ambush them from.
We said hello to a friendly group of robots running the first checkpoint and then spread out.
Release the Hounds!
I found a large parking lot just North of CP 1 on Bliss that exited onto both Cherry and Hickory.
It had a ramp to the entryway that was pretty well obscured by some bushes.
This would be my basecamp.
I dropped my bag and changed into the getup I'm pictured wearing below.
It wasn't long before I heard someone running up the street and darted out after him.
This guy accelerated away from me like I was wearing clown shoes.
He finished alive, at least.
I did this a few more times, scattering large groups of runners back up Cherry and away from the CP.
Hopefully my other chaser teammates nabbed some of them in the panic because for one, I'm slow, and for another didn't want to stray too far from what seemed like a good hiding spot.
So far I hadn't caught a single runner.
I realized the runners were leaving CP 1 via the next street over, which had a few 18-wheelers parked up the side.
I hid in front of one and waited.
Guile beats speed!
I caught my first runner.
He seemed a little pissed, which I figured was a good thing because he'd be a motivated chaser and was definitely faster than me.
He surrendered his runner ribbon and exhorted me to hurry up and tie on the yellow chaser one so he could get moving.
I'm guessing he caught more runners than I did, because I only got one other guy and he was smoking a cig while running!
I chased a few more though, and definitely sent one group right into a pair of chasers who were a block up from me.
Narrow Escapes and Where the Hell Am I Going?
I ducked back to my \blind\' to get some water and got a text from HQ telling us to move up.'
I started heading that way and saw one of the more amazing escapes of the night.
One chaser had made this runner turn and double back through a parking lot.
The security guard had come out of his little shack but didn't seem to know what to do about a couple of people chasing each other around his lot.
Another chaser appeared, and this dude was fast.
I noticed he probably had a foot or more longer stride on the runner and was closing as I moved to block an exit, but thought he had her for sure.
All of a sudden she kicks it into a whole other gear and left this guy in the dust, jetting into a fenced-in loading dock sort of thing.
I found myself cheering her on!
I didn't see an exit though, and figured the two chasers would team up to get her and wanted to get ahead of the pack so I headed North again, consulting my map and looking for an El platform to take me up between CP 4 and 5.
I got hissed at and chased myself by a goose protecting its goslings.
I met one runner coming across a railroad bridge, but within 100 feet of the water was considered a safe zone so I just tipped my hat.
I saw a couple of groups of runners around the FNORD Foods that was CP2 but didn't get anywhere near them.
I walked through the North edge of the safe zone to see what kind of crowd the CP had.
It seemed to be clearing out so I figured I should hustle.
I ducked into the doorway of a closed clothing store and changed back into street clothes.
This turned out to be kind of funny, because I soon found myself walking through the kind of neighborhood more in line with the tweed coat and tie I had been wearing.
I didn't notice at first, because I'd found myself focusing on everyone's upper arm looking for ribbons.
I realized I was carrying clothes in a shopping bag and wearing a stuffed backpack.
And with a yellow ribbon around my arm.
I must have been getting off the trail on my way to the train station because I didn't see any runners until I got off the train at Belmont.
I did get a lot of snooty looks that made me want to start tagging randoms.
They'll Have to Get Past Me First
I decided to check in at the finish and grab a beer.
I changed back into my suit and headed back out, determined to make a last stand.
I started heading East on Belmont and then back and forth down more dimly-lit sidestreets that seemed like they'd be inviting to a runner.
I didn't find anyone.
I got down to Broadway and heard running footsteps.
I turned just in time to see the same woman who had ducked into the loading dock back between CP 1 and 2 turn and run into an alley from about a block away.
I headed back around the corner, determined to cut her off, but there wasn't an exit.
I headed around the block, but no exit there either.
I went back around to where she'd entered and didn't see her.
I hope she made it to the finish untagged.
At this point I was only passing other chasers and decided to wait about a block from the finish line.
I sat there for a good 45 minutes on a stairway waiting and every few minutes someone would come jogging by.
All were chasers.
I decided I'd done my work and headed back to the bar.
Observations
When you're looking for ribbons on people's arms first, your initial impression of them becomes muted.
Physical attributes and style of dress etc.
are secondary and seem like an afterthought because you're already scanning the next person.
Adrenaline is the greatest.
Fun is contagious.
I had several different people from all different walks of life express a genuine interest in what we were doing and how it worked.
I am still not in shape.
Halfway through the night, navigating the streets of an unfamiliar city by myself, I started to get my bearings and felt like I knew where I was going.
Still, locals would probably do a lot better as chasers.
There is quite a rush to be had from charging up a street alone at a group of 50-100 people and having them scatter in a complete panic like you're a pissed-off Yeti on rocket skates.
This is one of the cooler things I've ever taken part in.
Thanks to the organizers, volunteers, and all 400-something of the runners, too.
I made the remark a few times over the weekend that I'm in Chicago so often they'll probably start charging me taxes.
And yet this most recent visit was infused with so much randomness, chance, and serendipity, so many truly enjoyable new people, and so many unorthodox new places that my appreciation for the Windy City has been completely recharged.
I meant to leave on Sunday, but I was having so much fun.
The Send-off
Before hitting the road, I had to stop by la maison de whoisjunk for some official business.
I cannot imagine a better way to be sent off he put a cup of coffee in my hand as I stepped in the door.
Then he gave me a slice of key lime pie that was made in heaven (by whoisjunk).
Then his lovely lady friend gave me several large canvases ready for paint, and two styrofoam wig heads!
I picked up Calyx, and we headed for breakfast.
297 miles lie between St.
Louis and Chicago.
They flew.
The Journey
We arrived at Kristin Gish's and met Steve Rules.
I had just enough time to change and give my best friend a kiss.
They had to dash to Wicker Park and I to Checkpoint 2: Tea Party at the Underpass.
Yas, EV, and Josephine were great company.
The Tea Party:
 
The view over our shoulders:
 
 
 We four superbly-dressed young ladies were waiting under the scenic 90/94 underpass to offer the fatigued runners refreshing cucumber sandwiches, cupcakes and hot tea.
And their excitement was infectious.
Downtime- when no runners were present- was also fun, as we garnered confused stares and bewildered questions from everyone who passed on bike or by car.
It was here that I also had the night's first encounter with the police.
They rolled past, staring, and looped back around to interrogate.
I walked up to the car and- this is very important- didn't let them ask any questions.
'Hi!
We're playing a game tonight, sort of a foot race.
This is a checkpoint, so many people are going to come through here, but only briefly.
However, we four will be here for the next 2 hours.
We hope this is okay (question mark, smile)'  They were sort of amused, but i couldn't tell if it was by our clothing, our tea party, or the fact that 150 young people were having good, wholesome fun on a Saturday night in Chicago.
They laughed and explained that they had gotten a call.
'Someone reported Bizarre Activity here, so we had to check it out.
They said there were people dressed as Pilgrims having tea on a blanket under the highway.
'  I jumped up and down laughing, and said, 'Yeah, that sounds about right.
'  I offered them a cupcake and we didn't see any more police at Checkpoint 2.
After playing 'base' for many excitable and sweaty young runners, we headed to the finish line to watch the runners and chasers roll in.
I heard battle stories.
I met more people!
And I took pictures.
The dreaded Beetle Bomb:
 
yes, I took one too.
I mean, look at them.
Sean and Laura:

Calyx with Antlers:

Spidere:

Zer0gee and Dax present the trophy:

And here we are:
The Aftermath
Gremlin graciously turned her birthday party into a JTTEOTN after-party.
There is something to be said for the type of people that SF0 attracts, as many of us were there meeting for the first time, and yet conversation flowed easily and laughter could be heard all night.
Team FOEcakes are great hosts, it turns out.
At the party, Calyx suspects the tower thief is present, and keeps trying to obtain a warrant.
He finally got a picture of it on his phone and shows it to me, saying 'We have to arrest this person, who is it?
'  As if on cue, the door opens.
In walks Zemaluco, and I say, 'Who, that guy?
'  When Calyx presented the warrant, the wily thief presented to him a Queen of Spades from an otherwise full deck, with the promise of meeting for a face-off the next day.
Calyx had to accept, because of the general complacency of the waning party attendees.
Little did they know, he had the tower on him at that moment.
In the morning, Kristin and Steve made us scrambled eggs, sausage, blackberry pancakes, and grilled cheese sandwiches!
Â  Finally,  Calyx and I headed to the park to enjoy the spring weather when we heard from the tower thief.
We quickly amended our day's plans and met the wily villain for a game of cards on Lake Michigan, an event we began referring to as 'the party at the end of the St.
Lawrence Seaway.
'  The match was intense and unending!
As the sun set, we were forced to drink whiskey in The Irish Oak.
The game went on, and we even gained spectators.
They actually thought we were playing for a dubiously-acquired cattle ranch in northern California and watched our faces eagerly, like we were reality television.
We were putting on quite a show, as the stakes were high.
Finally the match was won.
Calyx had beaten the tower thief and now he agreed to go quietly.
But it was a little too late to head back to St.
so we met Inky, Beetle Bomb, and Mean Jeannine for tacos and played more games:
like the old favorite, Guess Inky's Sign!
Guess Which is Bigger!
(note the picture on the wall, pure coincidence)

and Chess!
Later, there was an Oatmeal Creme Pie on my windshield.
Ink Tea, do you know anything about this?
(we ate it)
 
 
I secured last-minute accommodations for Calyx, Sutro stealer Zema, and me with an old buddy.
Â  Joseph Charles St.
Martin provided a fold-out couch-bed, a bottle of wine, and a Czechoslovakian New Wave movie called 'Daisies.
' All this at 3:30 am.
And our host stayed up and watched the whole thing as I nodded off.
Before we left, I gave him one of my Styrofoam wig heads in thanks.
He really appreciated it.
Finally, after more tacos, some shopping, and bean-gawking, it was time to get the wily thief back to St.
Louis for questioning.
Just outside Chicago:

in McLean, IL:

But this is the last place the tower was seen!
The slithery Sutro stealer made up some sad, sappy story about how he wanted the tower and the Arch to meet.
But as we were introducing the landmarks to eachother, the thief absconded!
He escaped!
He left no trail, seemingly vanishing in mid air.
We were so close.
perhaps there will be more Sutro sightings as the thief undoubtedly flees the Midwest.
But for now I regret to inform you that we were so close.
but Sutro and the thief are still at large.
I am shamefully bad at doing write ups.
Hence it has taken me nigh on a month to put this one together.
To be fair until fairly recently I had not had extended access to a computer, and until 4 days ago, I did not have access to mine which has made it harder to post things.
The Journey to Journey:
The start of My Journey began on September 8th when Firecracker and I (Beetlebomb) set out from Chicago on our bicycles.
Early on in the trip we realized that Journey Halloween was happening in San Francisco, and both of us wanting to visit the Bay, we decided to make plans for the two adventures to coincide.
Using our two feet and steel frames, we visited Madison and Minneapolis Then to Portland by train Eugene by bike, SF courtesy of ride share, day trip on bikes down to Santa Cruz and back up to sf by bus and train.
Many many adventures were had and many amazing things were seen, none of which is there room to recount here.
Finally the big day arrived.
Earlier in the day We helped Spidere and Anna One with bell assembly for their check point.
They refused to tell us what they were for, but in retrospect, my guess was pretty close.
Over Pie, we discussed how we had been wished a happy Halloween by people.
which we appreciated,but to us it wasn't Halloween.
it was Journey Day.
I was actually rather terrified going into the game.
This was to be my third Journey to the End of the Night, but my first one running.
The past two times had both been on my turf in Chicago.
Also, I am usually the one scaring the shit out of people on a bicycle, not the one being scared shitless.
We got there early which proved to be a good idea, as there were more people then there were release forms.
Finally we were off and running.
we took a lesser traveled path to check point one, yet still encountered several chasers.
during one bout Firecracker and I were separated and I found myself in league with a guy named Brendan.
Man is that kid stealthy.
had a few more close calls on the way to one met up with firecracker in the safe zone.
and headed off again.
It should be mentioned that Firecracker is a runner and is much faster then I, so it was no real surprise upon being chased shortly after that first point, that we lost each other again.
Continuing on with Brendon we happened upon a few of his friends one of which was Edwin Farnham Butler III.
In a parking lot a few blocks down we ran into annana who warned us of chasers around the next building, which we safely avoided.
However, not even a block later most of our group was caught, again leaving Brendan and I against the mean streets.
after that group of chasers almost every chaser we saw was disappointingly apathetic.
however a few chasers did manage to scatter our nearly formed group and that was the last I saw of Brendan that evening.
I hope you made it to the end friend!
arriving at 2 I was at the end of the big player rush.
standing  in line for quite a while, I met up back up with Firecraker, Praximity, the  KristinawithaK and one of their friends (who I'm sorry I can't recall your name).
Upon exiting the safe zone KristinawithaK and her friend were caught.
the other three of us narrowly escaped.
we weighed our options and decided to take the bus most of the way to the next check point, which ended up taking forever and not taking us very far at all.
the bus however was hillariously packed to the brim with a good 60% being journey players.
A mere few steps outside of the bus shelter and a block away from check point three a chaser jumped out of an alcove and got Praximity and I.
it was rather anti climactic and a little disappointing.
If I had to be caught I was hoping it would be out in the open, it would be a long and tedious chase dodging cars would be involved, and running, jumping over fences, down alleys, something!
There was no way to see around the corner, and it was the only way to the safe zone.
but what ya gonna do.
its all part of the journey.
I stopped by 3 to see Anna One and Spidere then headed on to check point 5 as I realized by the time I got to 4 that I would probably miss the big rush and I wanted to chase as many people as possible.
I found a group of chasers to travel with and headed out.
They were as well horribly apathetic, and though perfectly friendly people, much more excited about their later party plans then the game.
They slowly meandered over to 5 which I was quite ready to get to.
However being that we were in the tenderloin district and I am a 5 foot tall girl, flying solo didn't seem like the best of plans, even though I was wearing a cape.
we did happen upon one group of player getting off the bus, I didn't catch any of them but gave one of them a very good scare and after chasing her around the courthouse (?
that big fancy building down town) lawn, chased her back onto the bus she had gotten off of.
she was screaming franticly \ I'M GETTING ON THIS BUS!'
upon getting to 5 I met up again with KristinawithaK and praximity and (Brian maybe?
) we discussed a few tactics of player chasing and camped out at a few points for a bit but there were no players in sight.
They decided to head to noise bridge and I decided to try to out stalk more players, hoping that any minute the big group would start filtering through, also hoping to meet up with Firecracker.
To no avail, there seemed to be a pretty steep drop off somewhere between 3 and 5 I was there for over an hour and saw very precious few runners come through.
also what players were in the park many were just kinda hanging out ( I guess having given up on playing?
) which also made it harder to spot out the runners leaving the check point.
I tried waiting down a dark alley after 15 minutes standing alone in a doorway I abandoned this.
I then started trying to track players walking out of the park but was way too conspicuous and they would just wait for me to leave or go one of the other 5 directions out of the park.
Firecracker in the mean time had called and said she would be to 5 soon and we could just head to the end point together.
It ended up taking her much longer then she expected it to, which was not a problem, but unfortunately by the time she got there I was cold and getting rather grumpy (which really doesn't happen very often).
All the runners had passed through, Journey was coming to a close, and I had chased exactly 1 person.
Unacceptable!
We headed to Noisebridge, with me trying not to be grumbley.
All this was rectified upon meeting up with Anna One and Spidere and getting burritos.
I do love burritos.
I also love Anna One and Spidere.
Back at noisebridge we had a great time and met many wonderful people, as well as meeting up with some we already knew.
The next day Firecracker and I had brunch with Rubin, Sam, Sean, Ian and Jackie which was quite lovely!
Then we had to run away to East Bay and were on a train to Denver on the 2nd!
Back in Chicago for the Holidays then off adventuring again after that.
Bye San Francisco!
I'll miss you!
Don't worry I'll be back again soon.
Thanks everyone for making my Journey in San Francisco such a marvelous event!
Monday Morning, 18th of September, 4am.
I was in the shower watching blue and yellow body paint draining away from my exhausted figure.
Four hours earlier i had been dancing the night away in the thames mayor festival parade, i had only just arrived back, in one hour i was off to the airport to do one of the most impulsive things ive ever attempted, and all i wanted was to curl up under a duvet somewhere and hibernate.
One transatlantic flight, two bloody marys, and no hours sleep later I was wandering through central park dazed and confused as to why it was still morning.
I wasted away the week pottering around manhattan, gathering supplies for my Journey to the end of the Night, which i felt i had already started when i chose to board the flight on monday.
To tell the truth i was petrified about turning up to the game.
I was alone,  in an unfamiliar city, i was about to chose to run away from random strangers in the middle of the night, and possibly more scary, this was going to be the first time i met anyone else playing sf0.
And that first person i met was Sam Lavigne, outside the festival hq, two hours before the journey started (I say met, when actually it was more ambushed).
I shook his hand, introduced myself and explained how i had come on impulse all the way from London to play Journey to the End of the Night, while thinking all the time that i was sounding just a bit too much like an insane stalker.
At the start of the Journey, feverishly figuring out safe zones on the map supplied and attaching my brand new orange ribbon around my arm, I heard another British accent in the night.
His name was Alex and he too was alone in new york, here to experience the festival.
Time was short, and we decided to band together as the foolhardy british duo.
When Sam had finished explaining the rules to the 140 orange ribboned people standing before him in the street, looking somewhat like a bizarre dictator rally, the whistle was blown, and suddenly the mass turned into a riot of screaming and pushing.
A herd of cattle trying to escape from invisible chasers that everything assumed were behind us.
Almost immediately we broke away from the rest of the herd and headed off in the wrong direction along the west coast of manhattan, finding on our travels a random parked helicopter.
Having decided that the helicopter proper didnt count as public transport we decided to hook round and approach the first checkpoint in Korea Town from the north to avoid the humiliation of being caught so early on in the chase.
By the time we found the stranger (An asian looking girl with a purple scarf.
in Korea Town.
thanks Sam) i had already somehow managed to lose my map, and so had to spend the rest of the night hoping i wouldnt be seperated from Alex as i would become pretty much stranded.
After making the first checkpoint safely we backtracked north to the subway, getting lost temporarily on the way, and took it down south to the second checkpoint to find two girls in red playing cards.
At the second location we got our first taste of being chased after a small situation where the two girls had been thrown out of the bar they were meant to be in, and we had foolishly left the safe zone to try and find them.
We cleared half a block, pursued and screaming all the way, and dashed round the corner back into safety.
From there we found ourselves back on a subway train going south again, to find a man with a lantern in Battery Park.
This time we had been thrown together with three girls from Minnesota (Possibly called Rachel, Jess and Jenny?
), and also in the carriage next to us were three chasers, who fortunately had not spotted us on the platform, thanks to our sneaky hiding skills, so we were free to spy on them throw the carriage window, waiting for them to get off.
Approaching Battery Park, Team Foolhardy Brit had somehow picked up atleast 6 other people so now we were a rather obvious target of paranoid individuals, so it was not surprising that on approaching the fence of the park, we were spotted and charged by one of the professional chasers (you can tell because they get bicycles and tend to laugh evilly).
Cue a blair witchesque run through battery park, with everyone turning into panicked rabbits.
It took us about 15 minutes to regroup but by now with our nerves shot, and standing in the middle of a dark park, we were all unable to even understand a simple map.
It was pretty much blind luck that we stumbled across Sean with his lantern and fell with glee into another safe zone.
Sean briefly explained the changes to the checkpoints as the police were now starting to bug out and shut things down.
Creeping back out of battery park, we had somehow formed into a delta force like team, stealthing our way through the financial district, when two people wearing orange ribbons burst out from a side street ahead of us, screaming their heads off, it only took half a second for us to become hidden behind cars and in shop doorways, communicating in hand gestures as to our next course of action.
Unfortunately as a group we chose to go the now obviously silly route of up the ramp/road the people being chased had just come from.
By the time we had almost reached the top of the road, suddenly our way was blocked by the silhouette of a grinning chaser, one of the minnesota girls fell over while trying to turn and run and seemingly hurt herself quite badly.
Being the gentleman i called on the honour code and shouted \Pause!'
 half a day to regain my bearings on life
I apologise for going on for so long, but considering the distance i travelled to complete this task i felt i had to go into a bit of detail.
Truely one of the most amazing, bizarre and surreal nights ive ever experienced.
Thank you sf0!

Journey to the End of the Night, London
eek!
I hit submit instead of preview!
I'll add the end later, (sorry).
notes: I didn't get many pictures because I put my camera in a 'team mate's' bag then promptly got split up from him!
Along the way I collected other people's stories.
Since these people don't play SF0 I've recorded them here but put them in blue to highlight that they're NOT directly part of my journey.
I've put in overview notes, as my boyfriend said my story was too long but I'll be damned if I'm editing anything out so feel free to skip'n'skim the detailed notes and just read the bits in the big type for brevity.

Arrival - 21 Wapping Lane
Overview: 
Formed a team of 7.
caught buses from Start point to Brick Lane.
Detail: 
21 Wapping Lane was the home of Punchdrunk's Faust, a nightmarish cross between a play, horror film and fairground where the audience walked amongst the tormented characters in their looping hell.
The place has a bad vibe.
I arrived alone, my partner unfortunately unable to attend, but soon met with friends who had also signed up to play.
There was a great sense of excitement and anticipation, as JTTEOTN marked the beginning of the Hide and Seek pervasive games festival and was the jewel in the crown of our events schedule.
The gates opened and we all frog marched through the carpark in an orderly queue to receive our maps and ribbons (and sign liability waivers!
As our little band poured over our maps, Mr.
H started to plan a strategy to get us safely past the chasers to the first checkpoint.
proof:2, size:100, align:center
The carpark filled with people and soon roughly 80 runners had assembled.
We were addressed, via megaphone, by a uniformed chaser in a train driver's cap.
He instructed us to follow the map from Wapping Lane to the Southbank via 6 checkpoints, collecting signatures from characters at each along the way.
The first to the end with all 6 signatures would win a coveted Hide and Seek T-Shirt (and the respect and admiration of their peers).
proof:3, size:100, align:center
All this time the chasers had been loitering in the shadows and now paraded out in front of us as Alex told us runners of 'the catch', that whilst we were racing each other, we'd also have to outrun The Chasers!
At this point a half man half machine giant exploded out from behind as parked van and ran through the carpark to the massive gates.
He was wearing a cycle helmet festooned with red chaser ribbons making him look like a lot like the monster out of predator as he leaped on his pneumatic stilt legs to the space between us and freedom.
There were whoops and screams of shock and excitement from the assembled runners, as we realised what we had let ourselves in for!
The chasers disappeared out of sight to go and prepare ambushes for us no doubt, and we were filled in on a few more details before Alex let off an air horn and the gates were once more dramatically swung open - Mr.
H leading the charge!
The plan was simple assuming everyone would run either left or right to the tubes stations, we would run straight ahead down the canal to a bus stop further down towards the west, then get a bus to Liverpool Station, where it is a hop skip and a jump to the first check point - under the bridge of the Truman Brewery Gallery in Brick Lane.
It was now that I realised my fatal error in signing up for this game.
At no point had I considered that as a 'runner' I would have to 'run'.
My friends streaked off ahead in what would have been a cloud of dust had the heavens not opened at the same moment.
I ran without stopping (just not very fast) following the dots on the horizon, fortunately catching up with them at the bus stop.
We made it as far as the edge of Brick Lane without incident, skulking in sidestreets and getting thoroughly soaked through, until the first of our number was picked off from the herd.
Rob had been up front of point when we had arrived at a split in the road.
With a shout he darted away and we saw him no more, we took the other fork determined that he had seen a chaser and found our was to the first checkpoint already a man down.
Check point One
Overview: 
Team down to 5.
Got drenched.
Found the besuited ladies, lost map and travel pass.
Detail: 
Checkpoint one turned out to be a series of surprises.
Surprise one was that one of the contacts was my friend Rebekah dressed in a suit holding a silver topped cane.
Surprise two was that I had already lost my map - meaning that there was positively no way I could win now in any case (I got her to sign an old receipt from my pocket) and surprise three was that I had also lost my Oyster card (travel pass) which still had about Â£20 left on it  : (  We parted ways with Dounal, who joined with his friend Miss S and a man called Wonky Donkey to go and buy some crisps and beer for the journey.
Rebekah's story.
Bex had received a call earlier that day to the tune of - 'You remember you said you'd help out with JTTEOTN.
 She hadn't expected to spend the evening after work standing under a bridge in Brick Lane!
Brick Lane (for those who don't know) is home to London's curry house district as well as a top spot for bars and nightclubs away from the overpriced glitz of the West End on a Friday night.
Rebekah and fellow contact Katie found themselves under a bridge in a prime location for other people looking to be 'contacted'.
At first a little dubious, the local drug dealers soon found the game a great laugh, and started shouting out to lost looking mapwielders where the besuited ladies were!
Bex had a great night and met lots of new people.
Check Point Two
Overview: 
Split up by chasers, got separated from team.
Found the buskers.
Joined up with other groups (three times).
Detail: 
Having got to the next bus stop my lack of travel card became an issue, if I turned back I'd either hold everyone up or end up on my own - mapless.
A small whipround and I was on the bus heading for Cannon Street where we stalked around some impressively soulless monolith offices before zeroing in upon the safe zone marked on the map.
We'd been 'running' for over an hour and a half by now and darkness had descended.
The initial paranoia that had made us baulk at every stranger that walked towards us had wained as - apart from mysteriously losing Rob - we hadn't seen hide nor hair of a red ribbon.
We excitedly trotted through a little garden park on the other side of the road to the safe zone and the unseen awaiting contacts.
We saw a group of other runners with their pink and white armbands walking through the gates and were about to run across to join them when a shout rent out and the players across the road scattered in a panicked run - striding from the darkness came a troupe of chasers lead by the hollering Mouse.
When the panic had set in three of our number had darted blindly across the road to safety leaving just myself and Mr.
B ensconced in the shadows of the tree line watching the progress of the group of chasers as they rapidly came towards us.
As I was wearing black and Mr.
B pale grey (tsk, tsk, tsk.
), I stood watch whilst he hunkered down to better hide, whilst I relayed the chasers movements to him.
To my horror they stopped across the road right opposite us and decided to cross - heading right for our position.
It was apparent that they hadn't seen us but that would change as soon as they rounded the hedgerow.
They chose to cross right between the two entrances to the garden and I felt sure that they would see us through the less than ample foliage (I was unaware that in his sleep addled state, Mouse could barely see himself) and my heart thumping, I whispered 'run!
 dashing away from the chasers and away from the goal.
B had run forwards and disappeared through the gates to safety and I was left hiding behind a sculpture in th garden.
Thankfully Mouse's troupe had fragmented as well as deciding to enter the garden from the gate furthest from me.
I performed the worst rendition of 'comedy sneaking' ever seen peering up from behind raised flowerbeds slowly from right to left as they moved from left to right at the opposite end of the raised lawn.
There was another runner - a Portuguese girl, hiding behind the flower bed trough, and we skulked along together until I looked over to see where the chasers were and gazed straight into Mouse's eyes.
Expletives exploded in my mind as I thought I'd given us away and I shot the Portuguese girl an apologetic look as we ran as fast as we could to the nearest bus stop.
At the bus stop we both stopped and tried to call our respective cohorts - none of mine picked up and the girl wouldn't budge from the bus stop, so I left her there and headed towards the second checkpoint, two buskers who signed my tattered receipt laughing at my scruffiness.
I met again with wonky donkey, Dounal and Miss S, and briefly joined their group as we made our way towards Oxford Street.
Paranoia rife, they thought they'd lost me when I stopped at a cashpoint to get some much needed travelling money!
We reached a bus stop next to a tube station, a perfect opportunity to go buy a new travel card, I told the others to leave without me if the bus came before I got back and went down into Monument station to get a ticket.
When I came back up they were gone, but two new runners were waiting there with a welcome bottle of wine to share!
We got onto the bus and walked straight into a small crowd of pink and white ribbons and friendly smiles.
It was a pleasant and bizarre sensation to walk up to a group of strangers and start talking to them straight off as is you knew them, I introduced myself slightly hesitantly as Mink (my all purpose game playing name) and a couple of people recognised my name from the Hide and Seek website, they introduced themselves as Brendan, Kevan and Josh.
We all chatted happily about the Games Festival, strategies for runners, strategies for chasers and the merits of drinking alcohol on the bus and talking to strangers.
At some point during this bus ride I got through to Mr.
M on the phone.
Sure that they couldn't have gotten to far ahead I asked him if they were still at the third checkpoint and could I catch them up.
He refused to tell me where they were!
He was adamant that I had been caught and was calling up to get their position in order to catch them!
The actual conversation went like this,
Meta: Aaron, where are you?
M: I'm not saying because your dead!
Meta: I'm not dead!
M: Yeah, you would say that.
Meta: Charmin'.
Check Point Three.
Overview: Josh leads the chasers away.
I'm reunited with my original team.
Found 'Blind' Mike.
Detail:
We got off the bus at the bus stop directly opposite the safe zone, there were chasers on guard to the left and right of the entrance and we were now a group of about 15 people - none too inconspicuous.
The road was also incredibly busy and hard to cross, we were at an impasse, the only option was to charge and let the stragglers 'get got'.
However, as we tried to cross the traffic stopped most of us and Josh ended up on his own on the chasers side of the street.
I don't think I'll ever forget the moment the chasers looked up at him as he backed away from them, the look of surprise you see on the lion's face as the gazelle accidentally runs into it's den.
I felt slightly bad about darting across the road into the safe zone whilst Josh was leading the chasers away by himself a la Shaun distracting the zombies in Shaun of the Dead.
But his friends assured me that he'd spent the whole journey so far wishing he was a chaser instead, so he'd be happier this way.
M's story, after losing me, team Punchdrunk headed round the back way to avoid possible chaser ambushes coming up from Soho to make a dash for the safe zone from the west rather than than the predictable east.
The safe zone however having such a narrow entrance meant that no matter which direction it was appraoched from, it was well covered by the chasers.
They were spotted and split from Mr.
H who lost his A-Z and nearly his life, when he careered into the road in front of a taxi to avoid being caught.
Now down to three, Mr.
B, scrambled into a Subway sandwich shop on Oxford Street to hide from the chasers.
As the chasers approached they naturally cowered to a fight or flight position.
The chasers came closer and the trio ducked lower (perhaps hiding in a shop made mainly of windows wasn't the best plan after all).
The chasers came right up to the shop and Mr.
B grabbed Miss.
M, puling them to the ground to hide from their pursuers.
It was at this moment that a girl came up to them inside the shop.
'Hello Aaron, how are you?
I haven't seen you since our graduation!
What are you doing?
' she said.
'Yeah.
' grunted Mr.
M from his prone position on the floor, never taking his eyes from the door.
REUNION!
I was sat next to Blind Mike (the real one, not the two who had already fraudulently bid me sit by/on them as I came in) fighting off his inky advances when the rest of my original cohorts squeezed into the tiny packed space.
proof:7, size:100, align:center
Blind Mike and his gaggle of Swedish sounding groupies was sat in the most inaccessible corner of the basement bar in a beatnik looking pair of shades 'reading' poetry and drinking copiously.
He didn't sign the manifests, rather imprinting his thumb as his moniker in bright green ink onto the map.
However, being blind, he wanted to check that each player was who they claimed to be, by first tracing the contours of their face - with his ink covered fingers.
Each player was now marked with green bruise like daubs across their faces!
A fate I was keen to avoid!
There was a happy atmosphere as many players took a well (and not so well) earned break to enjoy a pint (and toilet break).
The bar having reached capacity a long long time ago, we spilled out into the little street of the safezone, and stood at its cusp to taunt the chasers collected there.
Unimpressed they merely ate some sandwiches and took photos of us in our cockiness.
Check Point Four.
Overview: Team back up to 5.
Found the ringing telephone.
Took the long way round.
Detail: 
Checkpoint Four was reached without event, we found the phone box but to our surprise there was nobody there awaiting us except an umbrella hanging on the cord.
As we drew closer the phone started to ring!
I went inside and picked it up to be instructed to write AMAX on everyone's manifests and then to head to the cascading steps of Royal Albert Hall and then through to the park to find the Russians feeding the ducks.
The boys downright refused to ascend the stairs as it would be a prime site for the chasers and we ran around the houses into the park from the side.
Check Point Five
Overview: 
Got to the park.
Surrounded by chasers, got caught along with Miss K.
Team down to 3 who we search for in vain.
Detail: 

The End
Overview: 
Most of the chasers go home, now a team of 3 chasers, Go to the river to try to catch the boys - but they never arrive.
Detail: We mosey on over to the Southbank

After.
I walked with Mr.
M and Bex to Trafalgar Square, home of all night buses.
We went our respective ways to head home and I ended up alone at 2am waiting for a night bus to Hammersmith.
and waited, more and more the temptation grew to get a Â£25, taxi home adding further travel cost to my already expensive night.
At about 3.
30am I was giving up hope of retaining consciousness,when a small behorned head joined me at the bus stand.
It was the devil stick awarded to the winner of the journey!
He had arrived after we'd all left and Alex had told them they were too late to play, but his friend had begged him and Alex had hastily explained the rules and the goal before shutting up the warehouse to join the chase.
He said he hadn't really understood about the chasers and had just thought there was a crazy man on powerizers after him.
They'd been trying to out-run EVERYONE and that's how they got there first.
He jumped on a bus elsewhere and disappeared into the night.
At 4am my bus finally arrived and I boarded, gratefully absorbing the heat of the collected masses.
It's a 40 minute journey from Trafalgar Square to my home and so I of course fell asleep and missed my stop.
At roughly 5am I walked, cold, damp and limping down a silent and deserted street back towards my home.
I watched the sun come up from behind the shops and apartment blocks of West London and laughed the joyful laugh of someone who knows nobody can hear them, as I realised I had actually journeyed from sundown to sun up!
Satisfied and beaming, I descended into my flat to impress upon my happily sleeping partner exactly how cold my feet were.
Friends and I met up at Eyebeam Atelier on the west side of town.
After signing in, listening to the rules, and brief strategizing, we were off running.
We mainly ran to get out of the crowd as fast as we could.
Off to check point 1, we decided to take the subway.
Subway took forever.
As we came out, I became overly paranoid and constantly looked over my shoulder.
Arriving at checkpoint 1, we discovered that there were already tons of people who had arrived there.
So onto checkpoint 2.
Again, we decided to take the subway.
Arrived with no issues.
On to checkpoint 3 which was really far from checkpoint 2, and pretty deserted at this time of day.
When we got there, we split from another group because they were being (obnoxiously) loud.
This is where it got fun.
We took a different route and got to be all sneaky hiding behind bushes and stuff.
Then just as the checkpoint was right around the corner, a chaser on the bike comes up behind us.
He says excuse me, and we think he's trying to pass us by until we realize he's wearing his caution tape around his neck!
We make a run for it and hurdle over park benches to reach the checkpoint.
Onto checkpoint 4 which was in walking distance.
As soon as we turn up a street to get to Broadway, we see the chaser on the bike who had tagged two people.
Their friend was hiding behind a dumpster.
We quickly ran in the direction we came in, and just as we turned the corner, another chaser appears.
Friend 1 was running in front of me, Friend 2 was running behind me, and the girl hiding behind the dumpster was running somewhere behind me as well.
I decide to cross the street to prevent myself from getting tagged.
I make for the opening of the scaffolding across the street when I saw that no cars were coming.
As soon as I got to the other side, I noticed that there was no opening.
Unable to stop myself at sprint speed, I hurl into the waist-high bar and somehow managed to limp my way to the end of the block and around the corner out of sight.
The chaser caught Friend 2.
Friend 1 and I proceeded on to checkpoint 4 no problems.
By then, it was 30 minutes before midnight and we had gotten word that there were already a lot of people at checkpoint 6.
Checkpoint 4 became the end of our game.
My favorite bits of the Journey:
Right at the start, watching a large group of players take off in a wave like a herd of gazelles at the approach of a chaser.
And then a little while later, the same thing happening on account of a car trunk slamming.
Folks were a bit on edge, I guess.
The giant shed of garbage on Goose Island was quite a smell to behold, and I was delighted to come across Rosie the Recycling Train outside a metalworks.
(According to the side of one of Rosie's cars, they recycle over half a million tons of iron a year!
) In general, industrial and work areas were my favorite parts of the Chicago landscape to Journey through - they're places I'd never really have reason to go to otherwise, and I love that I got to spend some time exploring outside of my natural habitats.
The band at Checkpoint 2 was delightful.
I wish my group had lingered there a little longer (although as it was we ended up scrambling through the final leg to get to the end on time anyway.
Submitting task now.
editing shortly.
My evening started late as I scrambled to turn a briefcase into a backpack using only climbing rope and a carabiner.
Success finally and I jumped on my bike to race down to Justin Herman Plaza, where a small group of eager players was already forming 30 minutes prior to the actual meeting time.
I rolled around the corner to meet up with my fellow chasers.
We were briefed, tied on pink ribbons, made plans and then disappeared into the night to stake out good places to ambush players.
Dressed in my white slacks, white jacket, and baby blue t-shirt I looked like an old vice squad officer on vacation from Miami.
The nondescript black briefcase that looked like it could be either holding drugs, large sums of money, or divorce papers was a nice addition.
Inside the briefcase was 2kg of candy, a pink ribbon, and a video camera.
The plan was to pop open the briefcase in front of players and watch them scatter.
That was the plan at least.
I locked up my bike and started wandering the streets, briefcase in tow.
The first few players I encountered didn't quite get it.
I popped the briefcase, asked if they wanted any candy, they said \no thanks\' and just continued walking to Checkpoint 1.'
One player did go for the offer of candy.
After asking about any illegal additives, he reached into the briefcase, brushing the pink ribbon aside, grabbed some candy, said \thanks\' and continued on to Checkpoint 1.'
Absolute failure.
I gave up on the briefcase ploy, tied the ribbon around my arm and just started yelling at people.
The bus stop on the corner of the block was packed with people, every single one of them keeping an eye on me once my identity was known.
There were many looks of confusions, often followed by a quick sprint away from me from other players.
It seems that many of them either weren't listening when the game was explained or didn't see my chaser ribbon as I stood in the middle of a crosswalk, players streaming by each side of me as I yelled \I could tag every single one of you right now\'.'
Fortunately for them I didn't have the heart to tag someone only a few blocks from the start of their journey.
Want Some Candy video
San Francisco Vice!

After feeling like Moses in a crosswalk, I decided visibility was what I needed.
That meant more ribbons that would make it obvious that I was a chaser.
After a 15 minute hunt for my misplaced bike, I headed back to the plaza to grab a handful of chaser ribbons from Sam.
I affixed them to every part of my body and headed back out into the night.
I spent some time biking north of Market, and west of Checkpoint 5, hoping I'd run into those players that thought they were being sneaky taking a long way around to different checkpoints.
Nope, either I was too far ahead of the pack, or they were taking more direct routes.
I headed over to Checkpoint 3 to give them a hand.
While dismounting from my bike in the safe zone of Checkpoint 3, I saw a player approaching.
I feinted as if I were going to give chase and he scrambled.
Carrying my bike, I half-chased him down the block.
He screamed \I'm in a safe zone!'
Up on the roof of the parking garage I found two agents pulling players aside, whispering questions to them and then zip-tying bells to their ankles and shows.
As I attempted to figure out what in the world was going on, the parking garage security guy came up and told us we couldn't use the 9th floor of the parking garage.
Long story made short, security kicked us out and we setup shop on the sidewalk in front of the entrance to the garage.
They were cool with this.
The one security guy even stood at the doors and helped direct confused players to the line we had going.
Boy was there a line.
At on point there were so many players in like that we had to give up asking questions and just started zip-tying ankles, one after another.
I have no idea what 30-40 of the players that came through Checkpoint 3 looked like, but I could probably identify them by their footwear.
I spent the next couple of hours at Checkpoint 3, watching as friends, familiar faces, and complete strangers came to get their manifests \signed\' with a zip tied bell or the occasional sparkly pipe cleaner.'
Then it was off to Noisebridge for the after-party where some players had already arrived after traversing the entire course in about 2 hours.
Oh, and don't forget the awesome Star Wars Cantina band that made an appearance!
Halloween.
One of the most striking effects of this game was the sudden re-ordering of priorities.
Personal safety and laws about personal behaviour, particularly traffic laws, became less important, even irrelevant.
The concept of private real estate property, in particular, showed itself to be surprisingly malleable, even non-existent.
Early in the game I suggested going through the grounds of a private apartment complex to evade chasers.
I went up to the door, looked all around, then headed back.
It looked impossible to climb or jump.
One of my compatriots stepped up and turned the handle.
We were in!
Moral: make no assumptions.
I found the most treacherous path to be that between checkpoints 1 and 2.
Early on, just after leaving the safe zone, we were scared by nearby chasers.
I ran back across the road, smacking my shin right into some construction equipment.
On a second attempt, one of our group was tagged and the rest of us were scattered.
One chaser ran after me.
I ran away from the checkpoint up a slight incline.
My chaser, slightly overweight, gave up after about a quarter-block.
Often, when I am frightened, I feel it in my back.
This time, my whole back seized up quite painfully.
I took off my backpack and laid down on the ground for a few seconds.
Having allowed it to run its course, it did not bother me again that evening, even though there were many more scary moments.
I rested half a block up from 3rd and surveyed the situation.
I didn't wish to go back down the street I was on and run into the chasers again.
After briefly considering the pros and cons, I jumped a chain-link fence into a nearly empty parking lot under the freeway.
Dressed all in dark clothes, with a black backpack, I scampered from one freeway support pillar to the next.
I made my way to the corner of the lot that was on 3rd but far from the chasers.
I saw a parking attendant approach.
I figured that the yellow ribbon would help in case I was caught or questioned - what skullduggery could I be up to with a bright marker on my otherwise dark outfit?
- but not seeing any regular way out, decided to jump the fence right then and there to avoid the confrontation.
I crossed 3rd, and made my way through an alleyway I never knew existed that followed underneath the freeway.
I skulked from freeway pillar to parked car, glancing ahead through the car windshields.
There was someone walking about 50 feet ahead of me.
I couldn't be sure he wasn't a chaser, but I didn't want to freak him out with my sneakiness.
I stayed out of sight till he left, then made my way to a pillar right next to 4th.
Trying to see who was on the street without revealing myself, I longed for a periscope.
I saw some runners on the other side of 4th, so I crossed and announced myself to them (I didn't want them panicking I needed them for herd protection).
We made our way together around the corner, debating how to make the last block.
One of them and I jogged up Harrison and around a donut shop to make it to safety on 5th St.
I found my group again, and the long wait at checkpoint 2 was a bit anticlimactic.
I offloaded my backpack to a friend who had been tagged and was now a chaser.
Three of us who were still runners took the 27, but got off earlier than most.
We made our way from Market to checkpoint 3 by walking behind/with regular people and engaging them in conversation, attempting to blend in, but always alert for the possible need to run.
We made it to checkpoint 3 without a scare, but there we found irate parking attendants who didn't want us on the ninth floor.
Not sure whether this was part of the game or not, one of us approached customers, trying to borrow their parking tickets in order to get in the building.
At this point one parking attendant started radio-ing in the situation, including details about my friend's appearance.
Luckily some game organizers showed up, gave us zipties, and sent us on our way.
I would remiss not to mention the following event, which had nothing to do with the game, but just showed how crazy San Francisco is on Halloween and therefore how well the game blended in.
As we left the safezone, we heard someone scream very loudly and fall over their bike.
We then saw someone else run across the street and get hit (not very hard) by a car.
He got up, continued heading toward the screams, and then turned around and went back.
I wanted to run to the safety of a bus shelter, but I also didn't want to be witness to a real problem or crime and not get involved.
Just as I went over to ask if everyone was okay, the cops showed up.
As best as we could piece together, the bicyclist was either fooling around or genuinely fell over, and the pedestrian who was hit was possibly attempting to steal his bike.
With the cops there, I left and joined my friends at the bus shelter.
There we saw that the 38 Geary would take 26 minutes.
So instead we decided to go to Market and take the 9.
Just as we passed the Apple Store we saw some runners fleeing some presumed chasers.
I took this opportunity to run to the island on Market Street.
My friends told me later that a chaser almost got me, which I had been completely unaware of.
The 9 came quickly, and I looked out in vain for my friends.
One was tagged, and one made her way separately to checkpoint 4.
The 9 took me to 11th, which was chaser-free.
I had only one block of Harrison to go to safety.
I walked halfway down the block, then walked onto the road to look for a good place and time to cross Harrison.
At this point a chaser started running.
Panicked, I sprinted towards 10th.
I faced a red light, and lots of cars driving fast down 10th.
A group of people waited in the road at the corner.
I yelled, \Excuse me
I ran past them, did a 90-degree turn and ran on 10th next to the parked cars.
The packet of cars passed, and I ran across 10th to safety.
At checkpoint 4 I ran into a friend who I didn't even know was playing!
My wife, who had separated from me earlier, arrived not much later, and the three of us journeyed together for the rest of the night.
We decided to take a circuitous route to minimize the chances of getting tagged.
We left south down Dore, passing a homeless encampment of at least a dozen people under the freeway.
We made our way to 16th and Potrero.
Seeing that the 22 was not due for 25 minutes, we stopped at Safeway for food and beverage.
We really let our guard down, because we felt that we were very much off the beaten track.
We ate at the 16th and Bryant bus shelter.
For over 15 minutes no nextbus information was available.
A Muni driver walked past and suggested that we walk down to Mission and catch the 49.
We decided to walk along 16th towards Mission.
All of a sudden one of my friends said \there's a pink behind us\'.'
I looked, and indeed, a chaser strolled 30 feet behind us, unaware of our presence.
We ran to a dark bus shelter.
He started running when we did, but he didn't catch any of us.
He told us that he had gotten tagged just outside of checkpoint 4, and was making his way to checkpoint 7 to try to catch early finishers.
It was a shock to us to realize how close we were to checkpoint 7 and how wrong we had been about being far from \the beaten track\'.'
After he left, we debated what to do.
I wanted to continue walking, albeit with greater caution, to Mission.
They wanted to walk or take the Folsom bus a couple blocks away before heading to Mission Street.
As we were arguing, the 22 bus finally showed up, and we sprinted around the corner to make it.
Traveling on the buses on Halloween was crowded but very jovial.
We met so many great people and had fun describing our game.
On Halloween in particular, the rules are suspended - people were openly drinking alcohol on the buses without even the fig leaf of a brown paper bag.
Again, a great night on which to have JTTEOTN.
We got off at Hayes and hustled to the bus shelter for the 21.
My companions wanted to walk the remaining three blocks.
I was absolutely against it it seemed too risky.
They agreed, and the bus showed up just a few minutes later.
My concern proved all-too-real: a group of chasers walked up the hill past us in the interim.
The 21 took us a block from checkpoint 5 we jogged to the safezone without a problem.
The real-life game of Clue there was very entertaining and a highlight of the night.
I particularly enjoyed the fact that it was possible to fail this task winning the journey required more than just running.
For those who weren't there, in this game of Clue everyone had been killed.
Each player was, however, dressed up and available to interview, and there were clues (including wounds) on their person and on the dining table.
We had to determine who killed whom (6 answers), and who used which weapon (6 answers).
Getting 6 right got you a signature and you could go onto the next checkpoint.
Getting all 12 right got you a shot of whiskey.
Whiskey for me!
Having been warned that a lot of chasers were waiting at Haight and Divisadero, we decided against the initial plan of taking the 21 and then the 24 to checkpoint 6.
Instead, we walked to catch the 71.
A disagreement on directness versus circuitousness led my two companions to wait on Market across from a bus stop, and me to run to the Haight and Laguna bus shelter.
They boarded a 71 and I boarded a 6 with a few other runners.
The runners on my bus debated tactics.
The bus driver wouldn't drop us off within the safezone, so we decided to get off at Pierce and use safety in numbers to make it the last block.
One non-player even volunteered to get off with us and run interference.
We made it without incident, and so did my friends.
The haunted house at checkpoint 6 was cool, but a little anti-climactic after the Clue game.
The Golden Lady offered to escort people to the 22, but my friends and I grabbed a 6 to take us to the 22, figuring it would be faster and not much more dangerous.
At 16th and Mission, we considered waiting for a Mission bus to take us the one block to safety - we saw chasers on their way to the BART - but decided to have some excitement at the end.
My friend and I ran at full speed in the street to 17th.
It turned out that the vehicle we were running behind was a Sheriff's van!
But, probably due to it being Halloween and craziness being par for the course, they just kept cruising.
At Noisebridge we got buttons, beer, and conversation with fellow players.
I met someone named Sandwich.
jason did a good job writing up the explanation of the game so i wont repeat the work.
click here if you want to know how the game works.
i am also posting his map picture.
hope it is ok!
piratey monkey and i (vladypus) arrive at the meeting place and join jason and co in one big group.
after determining the nature of the game however, we decide that it would be more effective if we broke off as a pair.
the game starts and everyone runs for it in a giant herd.
monkey and i almost immediately choose a different direction to get away from the group.
within a few blocks we are totally lost.
we slowly make our way and eventually we get on some bus, which is full of other players.
we notice that i have already managed to lose my player ribbon, and we cut a piece of monkey's off and pin it to my shirt.
we make it to checkpoint 1 (the fairmont hotel) and see many other players while we are there.
we encounter the the purples from the safe zone, wait for our moment, and take off down the steepest hill possible.
we make it a few blocks away and are totally confused about our direction again.
we are walking and looking at our maps when i catch a glimpse of purple over my left shoulder.
i turn my head back and monkey follows my glance.
as i bolt, she dives straight into the street and makes it across.
the purple is following me.
i think i am a pretty fast runner but every time i turn around the purple is gaining on me.
he is within inches when i make a sudden left around a parked car, feel a fingertip brush my backpack (a huge mistake to have taken) and make it across the street with purple in hot pursuit.
i run and run and i turn back to see he isn't on my tail anymore but i am terrified, tired, and panting.
i pull a quick right and duck into the first building with a lobby i see.
it turns out to be this upscale apartment building, or hotel or something.
and i run up to the doorman and say
\do AHH AHH AHH you AHH AHH haveabath AHH AHH AHH room\'.'
he says no.
i duck behind his desk and plop down on the floor (which understandably perturbs him) and start trying to explain things.
\im being ahh ahh ahh chased\'.'
\are they trying to kill you?'
he is too nice to kick me right out and lets me stay until i catch my breath while people are walking through the lobby giving me looks.
piratey calls me from a liquor store and gives her location.
i sneak out and we regroup.
the people at the store told her to get to hyde st and take some bus down towards the checkpoint but when we get on hyde there are no buses.
we are briefly harassed by purples on a go kart but we get away and make it down to market totally on foot.
luckily a bus is just pulling up when we get there and it drops us at checkpoint 2 (market between laguna and octavia).
here we met a few new players, met sarah for the first time (yay!
) and ran into nicole (who got separated from her team).
some of the players, i forget their names unfortunately, say that their apartment is in between checkpoints and invite us to come chill at their place for a bit, but we are feeling terribly behind and decide to try to make up time.
we cross the street to catch the bus and a purple woman tags us ever so excitedly, but is disappointed to find out we are in a safe zone!
while we wait for the bus we start trying to catch a ride.
finally someone rolls down a window, but they aren't going our way.
luckily the car behind them is sympathetic and we jump in.
the driver's name is bethany and we begin elatedly explaining sf0.
we continue talking and find out that she actually thought that we needed directions and had not invited us into her car.
but she is cool, enjoys our sf0 stories, and drops us straight into at checkpoint 3 (billiard place on geary between wood and collins).
we give her an sf0 pin.
bethany did not want to be photographed but agreed to this picture with sf0 pin

getting signature at checkpoint 3
here we are among the first to show up.
we hear about some straw hatted scoundrel which we assume is rubin but later find out is rob.
we feel happy to have gained some time and gulp down a pint.
we go outside and after sharing some rum with a tweed jacketed purple bicyclist go to the bus stop.
happy with our hitching success we attempt to get a ride while we await the bus.
everything is taking too long.
we decide to just bolt.
we get about half a block down geary before tweed jacket targets us.
we are on an incline and he is on a bike.
we make the first turn off the incline and hide.
he turns the corner and knows we couldn't have possibly cleared the block.
he starts circling in the street.
i am ducking behind an SUV, peaking through the glass and duck walking around the SUV to keep it between us at all times.
monkey gives up her hiding space behind another car and begins some kind of negotiation.
tweed jacket tells her that all chasers have a list of specific people to catch (total fabrication) and that she is not on his list but won't say anything about me.
monkey decided it is a good time to call me, which results in my obnoxious ring tone echoing through the street.
i quickly kill the call and luck out because at this moment his phone rings and monkey takes off up hill while i run in the opposite direction behind his back (not sure if i actually snuck away unseen, or if he was too into his phone call to be bothered).
we regroup a few blocks over.
monkey is on the verge of physical collapse and we are again disoriented.
we hide behind some bushes near the university of san francisco and study a map.
we decide to walk along fulton and maybe catch a bus, but instead we walk a few blocks and see an entrance to golden gate park, where checkpoint 4 is located (circle of peace).
we get about 10 paces in when monkey becomes determined it is an ambush.
so we run back out and continue to sneak along fulton.
we stop to take out flash lights and make LED throwies to potentially use as decoys.
it is now too dark to clearly see purple so we hide from every human being we see.
we find another park entrance and make our way in.
we walk through a small clearing in the woods and take one step on a paved road in the park when we see a skateboarder.
he doesn't see us run back in the woods and hide in the bushes for 15 minutes while he passes (it was later determined that there were no purple skateboarders).
we make our way along the road, which has no street signs.
we have no idea where we are and keep walking until we stumble upon the conservatory of flowers.
there are some people in the garden below and we crawl on all fours behind a series of 3 foot shrubs.
we go way around the garden, seeing some bicyclists pass on the nearby road.
we have no idea where we are, but are able to determine that the people in the garden are actually a couple having a romantic dinner.
we interrupt them to ask what street we are on but they don't know.
we continue southward across the street when we see suspicious looking bicyclists which cause us to freeze and afford us just enough time to see the purple go kart flying down the road.
we hightail it into the woods, i get scratched up, and we get separated.
we find each other via telephone and end up at the aids memorial grove which we determine to be on the corner of of middle drive e.
(a safe zone) and some other street but we are unclear as to which is which.
not wanting to give up our safe zone, we just go into the the grove and through a totally unlit path in the woods.
we ended up in some kind of circle.
unfortunately, it is not the circle of peace, but fortunately, it is directly adjacent to it.
we took a staircase up to what turned out the be Middle Drive E.
and another one down to the circle of peace.
by far the coolest of the check points.
if anyone has played that game crystalis for nintendo, it was just like that veering off the forest path to get some advice from a hermit living in the woods.
we take off southward and get on lincoln which is actually the opposite direction of checkpoint 5 (laundromat on balboa between 17th and 18th) but we think that we are less likely to encounter chasers this way.
we notice jason and co waiting at a bus stop but are unsure that they haven't been turned purple so we hide from them and make our way along the park towards crossover drive.
we again try to hitch a ride and are unsuccessful.
but finally a car stops.
except instead of a ride a purple gets out and starts chasing us.
we run and monkey yells \UNFAIR!'
unsure if it was a ploy we run through a driveway to the rear side of a house and hide.
we contemplate climbing through some bushes and climbing a 6 ft fence to the next block but decide against it.
we make it to crossover dr and take a bus to balboa and 14th-ish.
we don't want to risk a straight run to the checkpoint and nervously wait for a transfer.
it turns out that bus stops are safe areas but we had no idea of this until later.
all the previous bus stops that we stopped at, either had a bus pulling into them, or were in greater safe zones.
while we were waiting we saw two guys getting into their car and convinced them to drive us a few blocks over to checkpoint 5.
here we met orion, who gave us wood, and avidd, who was purple and also gave us wood.
avidd told us the best way to get to the beach was to go to geary and take a bus but had the obvious intention of intercepting us.
we were about to take off when jason and co showed up and we came up with a rather prudent plan involving transfers and such.
ian shows up at the bus stop for a while and does this amazing bullet dodging dance as monkey tosses those white snappy things that explode when you throw them at his feet.
we are talking as the bus pulls up and apparently we weren't fast enough to react because it takes off without even coming to a stop.
having already waited 20 minutes we are horrified.
we keep waiting and kelly and i start trying to hitch again.
and bam it works.
we shamefully leave everyone behind and dive into this car.
the guy is named mo and offers to take us straight to the beach.
except he drops us off at lincoln not fulton and we are too gung ho to notice.
so we stomp onto the beach and go from fire to fire, and some kid comes up to me and asks me if i am trying to start some shit.
i excuse myself and we go to investigate if we are in the right place.
we discover the error and run along the street towards fulton.
i keep pulling monkey by the hand because she is about to collapse.
finally we make to the fire.
we meet a bunch of people and have a great time.
the cops come because of the booze and tell us to break it up.
some people listen, we don't.
and eventually the cops get tired and take off.
many good times are had.
sometime after 3 i find myself twisted drunk.
on the way home i apparently tell some russian proverbs and quote some highly inappropriate lyrics, all in a bad russian accent .
i also allegedly fell while leaving the beach and then adamantly denied falling with my face half covered in sand.
good times.
anonymous at the beach

would be more visual or audio documentation if we were not so busy running.
This here proof will chronicle my own personal journey to bring Journey to the End of the Night to Los Angeles.
proof:29, size:100, align:left
Journey L.
started when I read that Dax was doing one in Chicago.
I thought, 'well, if Dax can do one, surely I can as well.
'
Actually that's not quite true.
Journey L.
really started for me within the first week I joined SFÃ?.
I went to the home page and instead of a picture of Lank, Captain Barbacopca and myself, (or Beth and her camera at a BART station, or an armed mailman in camo, or a cop's ass on a segway, or or or or.
) I saw this picture here:proof:25, size:100, align:left
Which a player called Robertish drew.
Yes he drew a part of his adventure comic book style.
It was one of the first things I ever saw on SFÃ? and I fell in love.
From that moment I knew I wanted to do a Journey L.
Well, I imagined a Journey L.
but I wouldn't say I was sure I wanted to be behind it.
At that time I didn't know how the site worked.
I thought all of the tasks and events were generated by some mysterious people who ran the game.
The powers that be.
But when I realized that we create this game collectively, and that anybody could create events, that was when I started to really think I could create a Journey L.
But probably sometime in the future.
And it was Dax that lit the fire under my ass.
It was Dax announcing his Journey (complete with cool website), that made me get to work on a Journey for L.
I needed to figure out first where the race would be run, as there are many good choices in L.
for routes.
After discussing it with a few people I finally settled on Hollywood.
Once I settled on Hollywood, I needed a route.
I knew a few things to start.
I knew I wanted to hit big cool touristy spots.
I also knew I wanted to finish at my theater, so we'd have a space to have a party and room to relax after the chase was over.
I also knew I wanted to start in Griffith park.
Because that way, no matter how many people showed up, I could get them all together in one place fairly easily.
Knowing those few things, the route was easy to figure as soon as I looked at a map.
And the route that came to me was this.
That was exactly as I drew it the first day I thought it up.
Even the bonus checkpoints.
I scrutinized it and sent it to C.
for him to scrutinize and find faults and we couldn't.
So we had our route.
Now we needed a date.
I knew I wanted to do it in the summer.
And the only calendar I looked at was my theater's performance schedule calendar.
I noted that we had a show closing in late June, and a one weekend only show on July 4th and then another one weekend show on July 19th.
And July 12th was open with nothing going on.
I set that date.
I went to the administration of the company and requested that date.
It was approved and so I announced the date to SFÃ?land.
I made up fliers and started emailing friends and posting on websites and generally spreading the word.
But I hadn't gotten very far in the spreading when I learned that my theater moved the dates of the shows around, and were having their big awards show celebration party on the 12th.
That show always always runs late and well past midnight.
This would not do.
So I went back to the drawing board.
I either needed to change the date or the endpoint of the race (and as a result possibly the route of the race).
I agonized over this decision for quite awhile.
I discussed my options with a few friends and decided because I'd already advertised it on the 12th, that we couldn't change the date (which was especially full of suck for me as it meant I couldn't go to my awards show).
But now I had to find a new place to end the race.
I wanted someplace indoors where we could hang out and have a good relaxing time to unwind after the ordeal.
And after a few more weeks of scouting and calling friends trying to find a place that was relatively close, I was no closer.
So I decided to have it end as I planned it, and possibly end in the parking lot of the theater if worse came to worse.
It was a few weeks before the event when I was at my theater and remembered the medical marijuana store next door to my theater often had parties in their big space some nights.
So I went over there and asked the owner if I could throw a party in his place.
After about an hour of sweet talking and explaining our game, he agreed.
That was a relief.
But the down side was in all of the time that passed where I didn't have a location down, I did very little work on promoting the event.
I did very little work at all except trying to nail down a location.
So the promotion was a bit of a failure.
But we got 20 people there.
And since before this event there were two real active players and four new players, that was a pretty good turnout.
So once I had my endpoint, I went about promoting, I passed out flyers (again) and fastidiously posted on those cool 'what's happening in L.
' blogs.
But I didn't do too much follow up on any of those fronts, as I had to make all of the tools of the game.
I had to design the manifests (I stole my design concept and ideas from the CGÃ? Journey Praxis of Dax's designs) I made trophies for the winning runner and winning chaser (again my idea was stolen from Dax), I made the stamps for the bonus checkpoints (another awesome idea taken straight from the mind of Dax) and I had to aquire red and blue material and rip them into ribbons for arm tying.
The trophies took the longest as I made my trophies out of tape.
proof:21, size:45, align:leftproof:22, size:45, align:leftproof:23, size:45, align:leftproof:24, size:45, align:left
So then came the day of the race.
That morning I made the mechanism to attach the stamps to their locations at the two unmanned stations.
I gathered up all of my props and headed out.
I called Loki on my way out to see where he was and what he was up to.
When I called he informed me that he was in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.
I didn't know it at the time, but he had just finished not jaywalking.
So I picked up the Loki and we went off to Astro Burger to install the first stamp.
We wandered around the establishment looking for the perfect place to put it when Loki came up with the idea of putting inside a free newspaper stand.
proof:1, size:45, align:leftproof:2, size:45, align:left
Then the two of us went to the White Horse to find the bouncer there and I gave him a sharpie and instructions to sign any piece of paper from anybody mentioning Journey to the End of the Night.
That accomplished, we went to the starting point where Captain Barbapoca was waiting.
I gave him the red and blue ribbons and had him make them pretty and in neat rolls while Loki and I went up to the Griffith Observatory to plant the second unmanned stamp.
It was quite a hike to get there, get around all of the people and find a spot that would go un-noticed for the night, but we managed to find just such a spot.
proof:4, size:45, align:leftproof:3, size:45, align:left
Getting up to this location was difficult and treacherous during the day, I can't imagine what it was like at night while trying to move fast trying to win a race.
Then all that was left to do was go to the starting point and wait.
And help make the rolls of ribbon.
So Loki, the Captain and I rolled up fabric into little balls in a park on a nice Saturday afternoon.
The first player to show up was LeftHandedSnail.
We were sitting hidden ninja-like in the shadows of a tree so were made invisible from the outside, so we saw her before she saw us.
I had to go get something out of Piper, so on my way to do that errand I bekoned her over to our table and she helped roll up her own blue and red ribbons, both of which would be used that night.
When I'm sure I know that everything is being handled, I call and check in with all of my checkpoint agents.
Lowteck is supposed to man checkpoint one and is running late being stuck in West Covina and unfamiliar with traffic in Los Angeles, he's manning the checkpoint with Mark II Robot so I'm not too worried as there are safeguards in case somebody didn't make it.
But I have no way of contacting MKII that day, I just have his word that he'll be there.
But I get calls from all other checkpoint agents and all is going according to plan.
proof:7, size:45, align:leftproof:8, size:45, align:leftproof:9, size:45, align:leftproof:13, size:45, align:left
By 7:30 just about all of the runners are present and have manifests and ribbons, but I'm stalling waiting for Lowteck to get to his checkpoint.
Because I'm just not sure if MKII is there yet.
But I do get word that Lowteck is circling for parking.
I figure he'll beat the runners, so I gather my runners together and go over the rules and offer up answers to any questions.
I mention that there are three bonus checkpoints, and say that I will give any player who gets all three bonus checkpoints and arrives at the finish line with a full manifest I will give that player anything they want.
I say this because there is a bonus checkpoint on the front of the Griffith Observatory.
This is a very difficult place to get to much less find in the dark while running.
I added the Griffith Observatory checkpoint as a joke really.
I never imagined anybody would attempt to retrieve it.
At about 7:45 I release the runners off into the night.
And four players run away from checkpoint one.
They run into the darkening park behind us.
I offered to give anybody clues if they wanted to attempt the impossible checkpoint.
Tac Haberdash asked me for the clue (the clue was the pictures I took of the location I intended to use just for this praxis).
Then he ran off to join his friends who had fled into the dark park.
For reference the three other runners were Waldo Cheerio, Black Coyote, and the Rev.
Odyssius Thwakinbusch.
The runners were off.
My job was done.
I decided to go check on the checkpoints.
I went to checkpoint one first.
And there just as I had hoped were Lowteck and MKII Robot.
Lowteck had music playing and MKII was dancing.
I wasn't aware robots could dance.
I was only at the checkpoint for a short period of time and left before any runners got there, but I did notice many many people liked MKII.
People in cars were honking their horns and waving at him.
He's a real celebrity, and cooler than I would have thought.
I left checkpoint one for checkpoint three.
Captain Barbapoca was at checkpoint two and I knew he could fend for himself in the sea of Jack Sparrows at the Chinese theater, so I went to the third checkpoint to check up on that group, and there was a friend of mine from high school dressed as a zombie in front of the Hollywood Forever cemetery.
He had a beach chair, and friends, and a case of beer, and seemed to be doing just fine.
So I left him and went to checkpoint four, which is in an awesome park that most people don't know is there.
River was manning that checkpoint with my brother.
It's a beautiful park with an amazing view, so I stayed up there for most of the rest of the night.
It had good cell reception, so I could keep tabs on all of the agents and chasers from there.
I stayed up there until the first runners arrived.
The first two were unlikely.
They were Nazzo Tinerlen in a red hat and Peter Garnett in a white coat.
Once they arrived, I figured it was time to move on to the next checkpoint.
I found Loki and Nancy sitting out on a patio with some chasers that were strategizing.
I stayed just long enough to make sure that everything was cool, and then headed off to the finish line to make sure that was all set up and ready.
And when I got there it was.
Lowteck and Barbapoca were there already, and next door to the party was my theater where a huge event show was happening.
I went in there to see how that was going, and for the rest of the night I popped in from one space to the next.
It was a few hours before we got word that runners might be on their way.
By this time, the block was surrounded by chasers who staked out corners on every surrounding block, they guarded every street and approach diligently.
My brother predicted that nobody would finish the race.
How could anybody get through this kind of security?
They had every approach covered.
What they didn't have though, was a way to catch Tac Haberdash.
I was standing on the corner down the street from the finish line when I saw Tac strolling down the street with a blue knit cap on like he hadn't a care in the world.
When a chaser saw him and his blue armband, he started to cross Melrose to get him, when Tac saw this, he waved and began to approach with a smile on his face.
When he was about six feet away, he double juked the poor chaser like Barry Sanders, left then right, then left again, and when the chaser's knees buckled, Tac sprinted for the sidewalk (the safe zone), when he got there he asked if he was safe, the chaser yelled out 'No!
' as he lunged at him, and I swear the chaser got to within a foot, maybe closer, and Tac threw the jacket he had been carrying in his hands into the chaser's hands, and while he was occupied, he bolted out into the middle of Melrose again, and he ran faster than anybody should be able to run, he ran like the wind.
He ran a huge loop and the chaser ran the short distance to try to cut him off, all the while shouting for his fellow chasers to come and help.
To no avail.
Tac was swifter of foot than all of the chasers combined.
Seeing that one moment of action made me want to run the race.
It was truly amazing.
And exhilarating.
It was so amazing that my words, I fear don't begin to describe what happened, so I made a map with a step by step of what happened and gif'd it up for you to enjoy.
Here, enjoy:

Ironically, all of the shouting that was going on to try and catch Tac, left the back side, the alley vulnerable, which allowed The Walrus to sneak in and finish the race second.
And there they are, the first two across the finish line:
proof:14, size:45, align:leftproof:15, size:45, align:left
Now I would like to point out an amazing fact.
I knew when those four guys went up the hill the wrong way to try to get the bonus checkpoint, I had a feeling that they might succeed, but I never ever would have thought that anybody who went up there would then finish the race.
It would take too much time out of their Journey.
But here's the amazing fact, one player managed to get all three bonus checkpoints, and six regular checkpoints, this is an amazing feat.
But wait, it gets even better, that player who did that was Tac Haberdash.
He not only did all of that, and was the only player to have done it, but he also finished first.
That is truly rocktastic.
Also, Lord Bojangles Winston-Jones was the best chaser with five kills.
He was on a bike and the bike was far more effective here than it was in ChicagÃ¸.
And here are the winning chaser and runner:
proof:26, size:45, align:leftproof:27, size:45, align:left
After everybody made it back (and I forgot how many people finished the race, it was around six or seven I think) we all relaxed and told stories of daring escapes and cunning schemes.
A good time was had by all and next door a friend of mine proposed marriage in an awesome way.
I also won an award in the award show next door.
At about two or three, the players began to get real tired and I began shuttling people back to their cars four at a time back up to Griffith Park.
When everybody was home, I stayed around the theater and hung out with my theater friends.
Until about 4:00 when I was tired and decided to take Captain Barbapoca home.
But as soon as we got into Piper we realized that the unmanned stamps were still out there in the night, so we went to clean up our mess.
The Astro Burger one was easy, but the Griffith Observatory one was not.
The park is closed at night, so we had to park outside of the park and walk in.
We had to hike up to the observatory in the dark while exhausted.
But we did it.
proof:16, size:100, align:left
And while we were up there in the best vantage point of Los Angeles, the best city in the world, we decided to take some photos.
Well, the Captain took photos of the city at night, and I took photos of him taking photos.
proof:17, size:100, align:left
Then we left, this time not as diligent at hiding from the park rangers.
A few rangers passed us and said nothing, and we couldn't figure out why, but as the sun began to lighten, we figured it out.
It was because it was dawn and the park was opening again.
It was a long night.
And we journeyed to the very end of it.
I took the Captain home and then dragged myself back home.
I took this photo just before going to sleep.
See how morning it is behind me?
This being my first 'Journey' event I wasn't sure quite what to expect.
Then as the time got closer I found out that there were new rules being added it made for an interestnig adventure.
I have no photos because this was a running event and since I couldn't figure out how to not potentially break a camera in the process I will have to skip the pictures.
(I did get an image of the play area and traced my route.
Check points are approximate since my manifest was taken during the game.
Blue are areas I was a runner in, pink is when I was a chaser, green is when I was returning to my car.
)
All in all it seems  the trip was about 7-8 miles considering backtracking and that was skipping two of the check points near Loring park.
Starting out at the north end of the stone arch bridge.
The first check point seemed like simple walk to campus.
I got cased out onto the Cedar Avenue bridge which was the wrong direction but is was one of my best options at the time.
Coming back across the bridge to the north side of the river I got tagged by a chaser.
Fair enough.
The surprise for him is that I was given a ressurection runner band.
Instead of just changing me into a chaser he got changed into a runner.
I didn't want to get tagged so soon.
Ok so what's my plan.
I went to steak out the Washington Ave bridge.
Got to chase a couple people but without a tag.
Eventually someone didn't see me and I was able to run up behind them.
It happened to be the guy that taged me so I was back to being a runner.
The unfortunate part is that neither of us ready the instructions that closely so we didn't swap our maps and manifests.
So I headed back to checkpoint one.
No problems but I arrived about 3 minutes too late for a sign off.
Being so far north already, and figuring it was safer, I went back to the Cedar Ave.
brige and crossed the river.
No sign of chasers anywhere.
Ya, they probably figured out that the check point would be closing and wanted to head people off at other locations.
I headed south on Cedar to check point 2.
I was given a warning that there were several chasers in the area.
The check point was going to close in 10 minutes, but already feeling a little worn from being tagged, backtracking and missing the check point I decided to approach it directly.
No problems.
Got my first signature and saw another group getting ready to leave.
Safety in numbers?
It was nice to have some other people around since getting scattered from my initial group back during the first ten minutes of the game.
We hit a bounus checkpoint and then made our way downtown for checkpoint 3 just before it closed.
Three more to go and I was beginning to really feel this.
Walking and occasional running on pavement is very different than an eliptical or bare earth.
We got scattered from another chaser.
Working my way down to checkpoint 4 at the edge of Loring Park I got caught.
this person was more familiar with the rules of the ressurection runner and took my map/manifest per the instructions.
I found myself as a chaser without a map and a little sore from the nights activities.
Knowing that I had a long walk back beyond Saint Anthony Main to get to my car I decided to quit.
It was a long walk back, longer than I imagined.
When I got back to my car and sat down the pain in my hips was what struck me most.
I didn't know they would do that.
Things I've learned from this experience I had decent shoes but they are really your best friend.
Hydration is key.
Taking the indirect routes can greatly benefit my progress.
I need to learn the transit system if I would do this again.
(Even without finishing the game I put on 7-8 miles.
I am sore all over from my waist down.
I shamble more than walk.
I did not make it through this Journey alive.

Five members represented the strength of Ã?rder of the Wild Onion in this contest.
There was PicÃ¸, who helped organize the event and made music for our amusement at the after party.
There was naming and Likes Music, who fell early, possibly erroneously.
There was Dan, the sole survivor to cross the finish line, and the pride of our Ã?rder.
His story is loaded with betrayal, dirty tricks, triumphs over adversity, and glory for our illustrious Ã?rder.
Ecce Homo.
But this is not his story.
This is a story of several triumphs and ultimate defeat.
A story of the folly of hubris.
But first, some facts.
There were six checkpoints.
The first involved robots distributing LEDs with instructions to place them on the bridge.
The second involved Victorian poets demanding spontaneous poetry or some added prose for their exquisite corpse story.
The third had a priest requesting you confess your sins and catholic school girls distributing grape juice and vanilla wafers.
If you could answer the (first) riddle of the Sphinx, you'd find out about a secret checkpoint, which would get you entered into a raffle.
The fourth checkpoint required filling in a crossword, the fifth had runners pick up trash in a park, and the final check point was victory.
Over 400 runners started.
Only about 90 survived.
The game started around 7:30, and the first runner crossed the finish line at 8:36.
Runners were still coming in at midnight when the game ended.
The chaser with the most kills finished with 18 runner's ribbons in his pocket.
Remember that last fact.
It touches me in a very personal way.
The joy starts at the very beginning.
400 people pour out of the park entrance and into Chicago Avenue, blocking traffic, giddy with the rush of being part of a mass of human activity and the thrill of competition.
The crowd dispersed, and we eventually found ourselves at a bridge, a safe zone but also a choke point.
A choke point with 2 chasers waiting for us at the bottom.
I moved back and forth, hemmed and hawed, and then lost my patience.
I was going to get through this or go down trying, at least creating a distraction to let my fellow runners make it through.
I approached a chaser, and when they committed to going after me, I chose my path and flew.
I blew right past and into safe territory leaving a frustrated chaser in my dust.
Witnesses called it \awesome\'.'
I quickly found a few more chasers between myself and my checkpoint.
Rather than challenge them so soon after sprinting my guts out, I retreated into a parking lot, hopped a fence, and got my first checkpoint down.
Between points one and two I found myself on a dirt road in a group of about four runners, confronted by two chasers.
The way out is through.
I went left and ran my fastest, straight past a chaser's half-hearted try to catch me, laughing aloud at him and his fallen chaser ribbon as I went on.
These two experiences left me confident in my own ability to outrun my chasers.
I met friendly faces at checkpoint two, but decided to go it alone, impatient and glowing with confidence.
I took the direct route to the next point, right through an alleyway.
I saw a group of about four chasers ahead of me.
I could have avoided them entirely, turned and gone some other direction.
But the thrill of cheating death was coursing through me.
I had done it twice and survived.
I could do it again.
They were on the other side of the street.
I walked with my typical fast gate, entirely nonchalantly.
There was a chance I could walk by without them recognizing me as prey.
I wasn't nervous even if I was recognized, I could outrun them.
One chaser walked out towards me to check.
Once she positioned herself to react to my next move, I hit a full on sprint.
I was by her, no problem.
One other guy cursed my long legs.
But the footfalls continued, hard and fast, and I ran.
I ran as fast as I could, not bothering to look back.
My pursuer was behind me and would not give up.
I pushed as fast as my body would go.
A hand was planted on my back, right between the shoulders.
That moment, that connection, was the deepest disappointment I would feel the whole night.
I stopped, handed my killer my red ribbon, and donned my yellow ribbon.
I take some small bit of solace in the knowledge that that man, that blazingly fast monster of a human being, caught 17 other people that night and took home the chaser trophy.
I wish I could play again next weekend.
I know I'm not the only one.
It was a tough battle from start to finish, two hours later it felt like I wanted nothing more but t chop my legs off and make a trophy out of them.
I met some extraordinary people on my voyage and hope them the best from here on out.
The night was a total success and the after party was great to.
Ill post pictures of the trophy in all its Glory!
Traveling to Chicago was indeed an adventure worth posting here - and the two hours I spent chasing you all around Chicago were, without contest, the highlight of the weekend, though actually one of the less adventurous parts.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
You see, my voyage begins and ends on the road.
JJason, Shea Wolfe, and I piled into my car for the six-plus hours it takes to drive to Chicago.
Along the way, we encountered a great deal of Wisconsin's scenery (much of it flat, repetitive, and smelling of cattle) before finally entering Illinois and then making our approach to Chicago.
We reached Chicago around eight, found parking (not easy!
) and made our way to Yas' place, where JJason and I were staying.
Then we went and met Iaman.
Iaman, JJason, Shea, and I went to see Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind - which was incredible.
And I learned quite a few interesting things about Chicago and its people that evening:
First, that you get more funny looks in a black fedora when you're alone than when you're with someone else in one.
Second, that the pair can top that if they start skipping.
Third, that Iaman removes his hat to eat - revealing the familiar cat-ears underneath.
Fourth, that you should never date your mechanic.
Fifth, that if you leave after the parking lot has closed they don't charge you for having parked there.
The next morning JJason and I went to the brunch at Dax's place, and he is even cooler in person than online.
I then spent the afternoon at a gathering of people from a different website (two Chicagoans were expected) which was not attended by anyone other than me and JJason.
Apparently the other folks had a medical emergency.
However, we did learn that Giordano's pizza is one of the greatest things known to man, so the afternoon wasn't a total loss.
That evening I was a chaser in Journey to the End of the Night.
And after that is where things start to get hairy.
I should mention that my mother is now in town, for business.
I had agreed to pick her up at the airport on Sunday.
and her flight got in at 2:30.
So when JJason, Shea, and I decided to go to the Journey after-party, we did so knowing it meant a very short night, as we'd have to be on the road at about eight.
Which we weren't.
I got back to Yas' apartment just after 4:30 in the morning.
I slept for three hours, and then went to go get the car and pull it up to her place to load our stuff into.
Unfortunately, Chicago is not a city I'm even a little bit familiar with - this was my first time there - and I have a crummy sense of direction.
I took a wrong turn.
I figured this part out quickly enough, and flagged down a taxi and had the driver take me to my car.
Then I drove back to Yas' house.
I had to ring the doorbell to let JJason know I was there, because he had loaned his cell phone to Shea.
Shea had been afraid his cell phone would die on him, and he wanted us to be able to call him.
One small problem: I had mistakenly left my phone in the taxi.
By nine, JJason and I were driving around Chicago in the vague vicinity of Shea's brother's house (where Shea was known to be staying).
I was looking for establishments liable to have telephones we could use, while JJason was looking for unsecured WiFi networks.
Eventually (by which I mean at about quarter of ten) we found our way to the University of Illinois at Chicago student center, where we were able to use a payphone to call JJason's number.
Shea answered, and the day was saved.
Well, mostly.
Shea had tried to reach me on my cell, and the cabbie had answered.
So we knew he had it.
Then Shea's brother called it from his house and arranged for us to meet the cabbie at noon to reclaim the phone.
And the four of us then went out to lunch.
Noon came.
Shea's brother and I hung out at the designated intersection with JJason's phone, whose number we had given the cab driver.
Then at about 12:15 Shea's brother's roommate called him to say the cabdriver had called to say he was on his way.
At 1:00, we called Shea's brother's roommate back.
It turns out the cabdriver had gone to his house and dropped the phone off there.
So then we finally departed.
After quite a while navigating Chicago traffic from there, we were finally free!
And I would only be five hours late to meet my mother, and we would be back in St.
Paul in time for dinner.
Back for dinner.
With a stop for coffee in Huesca.
We hit the road, and everything went smoothly until we reached Milwaukee, where traffic on I-94 rerouted us through downtown.
That added a little time.
More problematic was the construction encountered after dinner - which didn't seem that bad at the time but miraculously added more delays than we could possibly have anticipated.
At about 10:15 we were finally home, fourteen hours after setting out from Chicago and making a journey all the way to the end of the day.
By the way, I apologize for the photos being kinda boring - there's not much to document about how flat Wisconsin is, JJason borrowed my camera for the game, and after the game things were hectic enough not to get documented.
To prepare for Journy to the End of the Night, I made sure to dress comfortably and wear shoes that I can run or climb in.
I also tried to read up on previous praxises, as I did not have an entirely complete understanding of how JttEotN would occur, and to read up on others' strategies.
Before leaving my house, I made sure to stock up on supplies (CTA map, CTA card, cell phone, uncrushable determination).
I met up with Meredithian and Sparrows Fall before heading down to Wicker Park.
We met up with a large group, with other fellow foecakes, but decided that for the run, we should stick to a small group of three so as not to draw too much attention.
At the meeting point, we recieved our manifests with a map of checkpoints and safe zones.
We also sized up the other runners, knowing full well that many would eventually become our enemies.
We decided early that our main strategy would be to take indirect routes and to stay away from the big group.
This served us well as we trekked through alleyways to get to checkpoint 2, and we noticed that just a few other runners took this route (many of whom we had continued to run into throughout the night, as they had decided on a similar strategy).
Our first near run-in occurred as we grew close to the safe-zone near checkpoint 1.
Approaching the corner to Elston, we heard voices around the fence at the corner.
I stealthily crept up behind the voice, and quickly assessed that it was a chaser passing information via cell phone to other chasers.
So far, avoidance was working for us, so we decided to take an alley behind Elston, which eventually lead through a taxi depot and into the safe-zone.
After being taunted by a Red (who, thankfully, was wearing sunglasses - a fashion choice that undoubtedly would give him a disadvantage), we made it to the first checkpoint.
Checkpoint 1 was manned by two puppets that were dressed like chefs - or chefs that were dressed like puppets  - in any case they were puppety chefs and they were standing outside an old restaurant, and they gave us the clue for the next checkpoint as 'very formerly dressed' (I learned later that they were actually FORMALLY dressed, and I misheard the puppety chefs).
After getting our manifests signed, we downed a cupcake, called a few other foecakes to check in on them, quickly decided on our route to checkpoint 2, and moved on.
Another strategy we decided upon was to allow another group of Blues to move ahead of us, so that any hiding Reds would be triggered before we got to them.
We spotted a small group of three ahead of us on Halsted on the way to checkpoint 2.
But they stopped moving as we moved into view.
It turned out to be Gremlin, Little Monk, and Kevin (fellow foecakes), who apparently had the same idea about us before they realized who we were.
We decided to merge and travel together.
As we approached the safe-zone, I recognized the sunglass-wearing Red coming after us, and NOT wearing his ribbon, I might add (an unfair strategy, if you ask me).
But, he made clear his intentions shortly enough, and we scattered.
Amusingly,  when instinct to 'run away' kicks in, we humans tend not to look back - so i quickly lost sight of all but Gremlin and Meredithian.
After gathering our wits, the three of us decided to make the safe-zone our priority.
But as we approached, the Red zoomed out of nowhere and we scattered again.
I lost sight of Gremlin and thought for sure she was a goner.
Meredithian and I managed to make it to a nearby L-stop (all L-stops were designated safe-zones).
We were pleasantly surprised to find the rest of our group, and though shaken, still clad in blue ribbons.
We briefly encountered another small group of blues inside the L-stop, and warned them about the Red looming above on the streets (sadly, I must report that at a later checkpoint, this same group trudged in behind us, but they were no longer wearing blue ribbons).
When the red was out of sight, we crept across the street, through a dark and narrow alley, and bolted to the second safe-zone and checkpoint 2.
Gremlin's status was still unknown, and we all feared the worst.
Checkpoint 2 was manned by 4 very dignified young ladies enjoying a tea party picnic, which took place on the sidewalk under an overpass for the Kennedy Expressway.
We contacted Gremlin with our cell phone powers, and thankfully she was still blue, so we guided her to the safe zone.
(Admittedly, there was some doubt as to Gremlin's state given the last time I saw her.
We would have been very cautious about revealing our location had we not been in a safe-zone).
Our next clue was simply 'Green and Yellow.
'


We met up with fellow foecakes Jumpinâ?? Jane and Rex.
After some deliberation, they had decided to traverse the streets to checkpoint 3, and we decided to head back to the L-stop and take the blue line to Clark and Lake.
From there, we headed to lower Wacker.
Lower Wacker is covered, dark and sidewalkless, so it offers some protection from Reds disguised as civilians.
However, it was a little nerve-wracking since there was really nowhere to run.
As we approached the Michigan Street bridge, we spotted two Reds up ahead of us.
We bolted, not looking back as we dodged the heavy traffic.
We managed to make it to the bridge.
There was some confusing about whether we were able to cross he bridge from the underground level, and since there were Reds hot on our tails and we didnâ??t have time to discuss, we got divided.
Kevin and I stuck to the underground, while Meredithian, Sparrows Fall, Little Monk and Gremlin went to the street level.
I utilizing cell phone powers again and contacted Meredithian to reconnect, but as we headed towards the safe-zone, we spotted a Red seated on the other side of the bridge.
She was trying to say something to us, and while I didnâ??t trust her anyway, I couldnâ??t hear her.
I promptly got off the phone and skidded in the other direction.
Alas, as I turned around, I saw two figures fast approaching.
I thought for sure I was surrounded â?? doomed â?? my life as a runner was over â?? but thankfully, as the figures approached I realized that it was Rex and Jumpinâ?? Jane.
As we turned around, the seated chaser had not moved, and as we got closer, it turns out she was trying to say â??this is a safe-zone.
Iâ??m just smoking a cigarette.
â?  And indeed, she was.
Checkpoint 3 was inside The Billy Goat Tavern, an old and dank restaurant/bar with a friendly waitstaff.
We shortly reconnected with the rest of our group, and with the addition of Jumpinâ?? Jane and Rex, there were now eight of us.
The checkpoint people where clad in green and yellow â?? one green, one yellow.
As they signed our manifests, we were informed that a lot of people were getting tagged, and it had been a long time since they had seen any runners.
It seemed as though our strategies were paying off.
Our next clue was â??a man, a woman, and cardboard.
â?  We headed out.
We decided to take Michigan Avenue towards checkpoint 4.
It was flooded with shoppers and pedestrians, and while there may have been Reds at any turn, we used this to our advantage and managed to blend in.
Somehow in the crowd, Meredithian, Sparrows Fall and I got seperated from the group.
Half way to checkpoint 4 we ran into Kevin again, and made it to checkpoint 4 without incident.
(actually, there was a small incident.
We were using our strategy of following behind a group of Blues.
When they all suddenly ran screaming to the closest EL stop, we froze and watched carefully â?? but did not see any chasers heading towards them.
It seemed, to their and our releif, they had been afraid of a civilian woman with a red strip on a her sleeve.
)
Checkpoint 4 was like a piece of performance art.
There was a man and a woman wearing white jumpsuites, and they were worshipping a tower constructed from white cardboard and packaging tape.
They were unresponsive to us, and were maniacally chanting and moaning what sounded like names â?? some of which were familiar.
It turns out, the tower had writing on it â?? the names of all surviving runners who had so far come through the checkpoint.
It was frightening how few in number these names were.
We waited for Gremlin, Little Monk, and Rex to join us.
Sadly, Jumpinâ?? Jane did not accompany them.
Losing a member of our group was disorienting â?? she had only just joined us.
But we were determined to move on.
But what was the next clue?
One of us realized that among their chanting, the man and woman in white jumpsuites were crying out â??Two girls, one dress!
Two girls, one dress!
â?  Was this our next clue?
We picked up two other runners - Ninja and friend, and after adding our names to the tower, we let Kevin guide us to checkpoint 5, as he had some experience navigating south loop.
He did a good job moving us through side streets as far as Canal.
We were nervous about taking such a direct route to checkpint 5, but Canal was the only clear path.
Plus, the street seemed vacant, and it was open enough that we knew we could see a Red coming from any distance.
However, Canal turned out to be our biggest mistake of the night.
As we approached the light at 11th street, we saw a suspicious character chatting on his phone and waiting to cross the street ahead of us.
Something wasnâ??t right about this guy, but we were so close to the checkpoint, and there was really no turning back, that we cautiously continued forward.
Plus, he began to cross the street.
We glared, tryin to spot a red ribbon, which was not in sight.
But as we approached, it became clear that his cell phone call was a faÃ§ade, used to block his ribbon from view.
Just as we noticed this, he came after us.
So far, this was the closest we had come to a Red, and it was terrifying.
Most of us ran down a deserted alley, which was a gamble since there was no exit in sight.
Once we turned a corner, we realized we were not being chased, but there were two people missing â?? Meredithian and Keven.
Did the chaser get them?
Where they still in persuit?
It was too grim to consider, so we tried to focus on getting out and to the safe-zone.
The only clear path was into a dark parking garage that was under the checkpoint.
As near to the safe-zone as we were, we knew there must be more Reds close by, but hopefully, there would be a way up and out.
As quietly as possible, we crept into the garage.
There where only two clear exits â?? a stairwell going up, and a ramp going out to the street.
I scouted the back of the garage as well, which revealed a short wall, over which was darkness â?? a third exit, but only to be used as a last resort.
Nearing the staircase, we heard unhuman mumbling and pounding from above.
Backing away, we moved towards the ramp.
This seemed like our best escape.
Little Monk and Sparrowsfall were the brave leaders as we inched up the ramp.
They spotted a group of reds around the bend, too close for comfort, and frantically whispered to go back.
We started shambling away, thinking the reds had not seen us.
As we quickly shifted back into the garage, I looked behind me, and Iâ??m glad I did.
I witnessed one or two reds pounding after us which apparently no one had seen yet.
I scramed, â??THEREâ??S A RED RIGHT THERE!
â?  and we all ran as fast as we could towards the back exit â?? hurtling the wall into the darkness.
Apparently, the back entrance to the parking garage was the correct choice, as the Reds did not follow us.
Gremlin, Little Monk, Sparrows Fall, Dex and I were together, but Ninja and her friend were not in sight.
Perhaps the Red went after Ninja and her friend, but again, we focused on getting to the safe-zone.
We found ourselves underneath the Roosevelt St.
bridge, and there we had two options.
One was the empty trainyard (which really lead to nowhere), or through a fenced-in parking lot, with only a 15 ft gateway exit.
This was risky, as  50 feet away, on the edge of the safe-zone, were a small group of Reds, waiting.
We were moving quickly and Sparrowsfall suggested we get out of the fenced-in area.
Which was a good idea, and everyone followed as she darted out and across the street, but I did not like the idea of running so close past the gaggle of Reds.
One of them started to go after them, but decided to stop in the gateway, trapping me in.
At first, I thought I had made a mistake.
I decided to run back under the bridge, and the Red did not persue, but grabbed some of his riends and ran across the street after the other foecakes.
Now I options â?? I could either go back into the parking garage, try to get out through the gate, go through the railyard, or investigate for some other exit, which is what I ended up doing.
It turns out, there was a  slim break in the fence which led to a narrow area between the fence and the bridge.
While the bridge was high, it grew closer to the ground as it went towards Canal â?? right where the group of Reds were standing.
Though risky, I decided this was my exit.
I trudged through the shrubbery and litter along the side of the bridge, and as I got as far to the end as I could, I was able to peek over the top of the bridge rail (about 6 ft off the ground), and was pleased to see that only one Red stood on the corner.
Less than 8 feet away from the Red, I had to sieze the moment as his back was to me, and he may turn around at any moment.
I pulled myself up and lunged over the rail, directly behind the chaser.
On Roosevelt.
But where were my friends?
I was safe, but all alone, and I didnâ??t know where anyone was.
First, I went for the checkpoint, which I found in a bustling diner on the corner of Canal and Roosevelt.
The two girls (one dress) sat quietly in the back of the diner, in what someone described as a David Lynch-like scene.
They where happy to hear my harrowing tail, and signed my manifest.
As I left the diner to get a better street view and to try to connect with my friends, the group who were faked out by the red stripe-wearing civilian near checkpoint 4 skulked into the diner, having just been tagged.
I was scared for my foecakes.
Over the next 20 minutes, Sparrows Fall, Little Monk, Rex, Kevin, Gremlin, and finally Meredithian all made it to the checkpoint, each with their own story of near escape.
While waiting there, countless newly turned Reds grudgingly strode into the diner, reminders of how lucky we all were.
Ninja and her friend, however, were not seen again.
We heard later that the Reds who chased us out of the parking garage went after them, and they were caught somewhere near the produce section of the Whole Foods to which the parking garage belonged.
RIP Ninja and friend of Ninja.
We had come as far as checkpoint 5, and were determined to make it to the next and final checkpoint.
However, like our path to checkpoint 5, we did not have a lot of options.
There was some disagreement about the route.
3 of us wanted to go straight through â?? we had outsmarted and outran every Red we had encountered so far, so why not?
On the other hand, the other 4 wanted to stick to our current strategy of staying away from direct paths, and were convinced that once we cleared the safe-zone, Roosevelt would be crawling with Reds.
Democracy ruled, and we headed north a couple blocks, and cut across to the lake, fortunately without seeing another Red.
Crossing into the final safe-zone was accompanied by celebratory high fives all around.
We had traveled for almost 5 hours, and had traversed approximately 9 miles of road, allyway, train, and finally lakepath.
Though we had lost a few along the, the 7 of us  had made it together.
We strode to the final checkpoint, and approached with our arms raised victoriously.
Arriving at the final checkpoint reminded me of the final scene of alice in wonderland.
We had gone through this surreal adventure, complete with danger and excitement, encountering a host of bizarre characters, who were all gathered for a big finale.
Though exhausted, we hung out for a while, and chatted with chasers, runners and volunteers alike.
Though exhausting, the Journey to the End of the Night introduced me to sides of my city that I have never seen before.
It was the most fun I have ever had in Chicago, and Iâ??m happy that the memory of this adventure will remain with me for a long time.
It was our fourth year participating in CG0's journey to the end of the night.
Every year prior we had run, but I knew I couldn't handle that this year.
Did you see the crazies at checkpoint 5?
I was the one who offered you a blanket.
I'm not much of a writer.
I may write more.
I may not.
mark and I arrived early with shama and evan to start setting up.
I was the one screaming instructions at you when you were in line (AND DON'T LOSE YOUR MAP!
) and wrangling one of the registration tables.
After everyone was signed up, I decided to take some video of the astounding number of people who were participating.

Prologue
It had been four months now that I had been living in the exile.
The remote mountain village in the icy north, which I had chosen as an escape had become a second home to me.
The catchers might not search for me here.
Or they might, but every newcomer was eyed with suspicion, and the news would spread faster than they can run.
I felt safe.
I was becoming lazy.
I caught myself smiling at the faces that crossed my path, and taking the shortest path around corners and into places I could not look into first.
The memories of the chase clearly had faded, and lingering carelessness is exactly the kind of slow poison that kills you with a sudden stroke.
I felt at risk.
A Journey
There was not much I had to prepare.
I left the capsule with a friend I could trust.
I was quite certain she could not comprehend the pandoric implications of the item - in its hibernation stasis it looks unsuspicious enough.
And I grabbed the bag that always stands ready in case I have to move on.
I had heard about the training grounds from a mercenary.
She had worked her way up through the ranks of the commons, through hard work and tricks that were dirtier than her peers.
When I last saw her, she was running alongside me - by now she is one of the instructors and bearing the insignia of a centarch.
She would organize a race to gather a selection among those who train under her.
Not many would make it, but this time you wouldn't pay for a failure with your soul.
It would just leave you crawling in the dirt of the training grounds for another year or two.
Some, like me, would gladly go back to this predictable life full of simple tasks.
I felt a pinch of nostalgia.
My pack and my feet brought me all the way to the capital of Magyar, famous for shaping some of the best runners of the continent.
Not only were they hard and fast, but they grew up in vast cave systems that spanned under the ground my feet now touched.
Their orientation skills in the dark were second to none.
This night, they would be my competition - and my opponents.
Now, I felt my heart beating faster.

The Gathering
The first thing that struck me when I entered the gathering was how young the attendees were.
Had it been that long since I started out myself?
They were laughing and chatting, in the carefree and curious atmosphere that surrounds the minutes before the chase.
Flying merchants were selling greasy food and healthy tonics that promised to enhance a runner's reflexes or endurance.
The annalists of the event crisscrossed through the crowd, taking down the names and the random quotes of each participant.
proof:5, size:100, align:center
I met familiar faces too.
The final runs regularly draw not only the trainees, but just as many of the thrill-seekers, the haphazard, the rusty veterans.
I knew not if it was just only one of these words that should apply to me.
There were about a hundred and fifty standing here, idling or busy with the final preparations.
You could tell by their faces which ones had an aspiration to win the race.
For the others it would be just one more story to tell near the evening's fire.
And there was her.
The instructor.
Issuing commands to the guards and the muscular helpers that finalized the preparations.
She stood on an elevated position in a stunning one-piece combat suit that must have cost a fortune, and it was obvious that it was tailored to provide protection and comfort to this one precious body only.
proof:7, size:100, align:center
Race
A voice cuts through the air.
The speaker is a scarred veteran, reading the salute to the runners, and reading the rules that everyone knows by heart.
Then we are introduced to our chasers.
Last year, they were among the best that made it through the race, this year, they wear the masks and the red ribbons of the soul-eaters.
Everyone is waiting for the final clue that will tell us where the first station is to find.
proof:8, size:100, align:center
I take a look at the maps we have been handed out, and I try to make sense of the foreign words that are being yelled at me.
The roads and alleys in this place will bear no names that speak to me.
I will be lucky if the people speak my language.
The only thing I am familiar with is the body language of the hunters, the gatherers, the vicious and the prey.
And right now, I am surrounded by people that are eager, nervous and hungry for action - prey.
One
There must have been a go signal, as people start moving.
I start running.
Together with the first handful we cross the bridge to the Western part of town.
This Journey will lead us across a lot of bridges.
Since the chasers are still assembled at the start, we do not expect to face much opposition.
The first runners have overestimated their legs and fall behind.
Some of them make good for that by boarding a street car.
I reach the first checkpoint with a group of about twenty, and we are presented with a light test of our artistic skills.
Our results shall be used as decoration for the upcoming town festivals, they say - but I assume that it is just meant to taunt the spirits of the fighters as they have to struggle with colours and pens.
proof:4, size:100, align:center
Two
The second checkpoint is far to the North, far beyond what we should be travelling on foot.
There are only two cars running in the general direction, and I board one with a handful of five people.
I realize that I forgot to ask for a clue for the second checkpoint.
After a good bit of persuasion, one of the five admits to speak my tongue.
He does not remember the clue, but is certain that it refers to an old Turkish bathhouse on the top of the mountain we are heading to.
I thank the man, whom I shall later get to know as my strongest opponent, and who is wearing a bold bright yellow shirt as if to deny the presence of danger.
I concentrate on our surroundings again.
proof:10, size:100, align:center
As we reach a large place, the street car rattles to a halt in the middle of a crowd.
The doors open.
Some of us start running, not me.
The crowd moves.
I cannot see any chasers, but I stay wary.
The other four try to reach another streetcar, three make it.
When there still is nobody chasing, I make my move.
I decided early not to stay on the main road, but to climb the mountain streets on foot.
I know that chasers have to be wary of their efficiency as well as the runners are, and do not expect any to expose themselves to the strenuous task of patrolling a steep incline for a yet thin trickle of runners.
My expectations were right, and I reach the top of the hill shortly behind the group I left at the street car.
proof:11, size:100, align:center
The bathhouse is locked and deserted.
The group is startled, and begins to check the small gates and alleys that surround it.
Some even argue that the guardians of the checkpoint may not have arrived yet.
I know better and move on.
In a side street, I try to describe to a man and his dog the uniform of the guardians with hands and feet.
As I imitate the salute of the guard, the man starts laughing, and points me down a narrow flight of stairs, where the checkpoint is hidden.
It sits on the top of the stairs, and the merry guardspeople explain me that I should count them.
I smile at their sense of humour, knowing that the taunting is part of the game they play with us.
Without arguing, I start running down the stairs, making an estimate in my head.
I soon realize that some of the stairs are missing, others are broken beyond recognition.
Out of sight behind a bend, I pause for a moment, surveying the remaining height.
I turn around, run back up, and reach the checkpoint again.
Pretending to be exhausted, I provide two numbers, one for the left side of the stairs, the other for the right side.
The guardian is visibly impressed with my thoroughness and gives me her stamp on my documents.
I set up the smile that is part of the game I play with them.
Three
The other checkpoint will be on the other side of the river again.
To avoid the bridge, I go back the way I came, down the steep incline.
I wait out of sight of a streetcar stop, surveying the large street and the narrow alley behind my back.
As the streetcar stops, I use it as a sight block and run into one of the open doors.
As we cross the bridge, there are no other runners on board.
On the other side of the bridge, I survey the first stop of the car.
I cannot see any chasers, but I wait.
Shortly before the doors close, I move, run around the edge of the car, and disappear into a dark alley.
No one is in front of me.
Nearing the next crossroads, I turn around and see no one following me.
The third checkpoint is four blocks away, straight down the road.
I choose not to take the direct route, and avoid groups of people.
A bus drives in my direction, and I board it.
The other passengers stare at me, panting and sweating.
I make use of the welcome rest and survey the surroundings.
As the bus turns, I am about to signal the driver to stop, as I see a flash of blue running down the alley, and a flash of red on an interception course.
One stop later, I disembark and head to the checkpoint, where I meet the man in the yellow shirt again.
We are first asked to run a distance, then told to inflate a balloon.
One more task meant to show us how close we are to our limits, but we comply with a straight face.
The time to sweat and pant is not now and here.
Four
She almost got me, but she did not expect me to come straight at her.
I was running at a leisurely pace towards a more remote bus stop, and I admit I did not expect the chasers to guard this side of the checkpoint.
But eventually it had to happen.
When I noticed her, it was too late to get away and my fighting reflexes kicked in.
I yelled at her, and started running.
In the last moment before we crashed, I ducked to the right, rolled, came back up and kept running.
My momentum carried me and I reached a good distance before I looked behind me to see her still confused, standing on the same spot.
She must have been new - I doubt that the maneuver would have impressed any of the more seasoned chasers.
After this, I immediately acted more careful and reached the bus without further incidents.
It stood at the station for a while until the driver would decide that enough passengers have boarded to allow him to earn his fare.
Eventually, two other runners boarded the vehicle, and we greeted.
Their faces were young, but they were confident, and they have proven some skills to reach this place this early.
From the faces we had seen, and chats with the guardians, we concluded that we must be among the first runners to head towards checkpoint four.
Jokingly I asked them if they wanted to be the bait, or if I should be.
I had to explain the word.
The bait.
Leaving the safe zone first makes you that.
The first blue ribbon to move will attract the attention, and tell the positions of any chasers that catch on.
We discussed at which stop to leave the car, and when they declared they would take the first one after the bridge, I taunted them once more that this would make them the bait.
We laughed.
They left the bus after the bridge and ran right into the arms of a chaser.
I had not seen him either.
I smiled, the smile that is part of the game, and waved.
Once again, I decided I would be more careful.
Now I was on my own, and the next bus stop would be right in front of the Imperial castle.
Maybe a good spot to disappear, maybe the opposite.
proof:12, size:100, align:center
I did not have much time to survey upon disembarking, but no one moved towards me in the darkness.
I headed to a row of parked cars.
There were three figures with red ribbons walking down the street.
I stopped, with my arm and the ribbon hidden behind the roof of a car, pretending to be busy.
I looked around.
They were the only patrol, and heading down the street in the direction I was headed.
I followed them at a distance to where they climbed onto one of the vantage points on the castle walls.
Once or twice, one of them turned, but I doubted they could discern my blue ribbon in the darkness.
Possibly, they did not even expect someone to be as bold as to follow them.
When they were high up enough on their wall, I ran down the road leading down the other side of the castle hill.
I saw them pointing at me, but they would have had to backtrack half the way to just get on my level.
I raced down a flight of stairs and disappeared in the network of alleys above checkpoint four.
From the road I was following, several stairs and steep alleys would lead towards the park that was the safe zone.
A figure waited at the bottom of the first stair I was examining.
It disappeared behind a corner before I could make out if it was carrying a ribbon or not - and so did I.
The second alley seemed safe, and I descended.
I waited in the darkness until the street was safe to cross, and a short sprint would make me reach the safe zone.
I was asked for poetry, and to hug a tree.
And I was told that I was the second to reach the safe zone.
I saw the bright yellow shirt of the runner that was first disappear between the trees.
Five
This one silly comment and that sight had made me fall into the all too common trap.
I had again become too confident.
I wanted to keep up with the first.
I jogged out of the safe zone towards where I expected a street car running, to once again cross to the other side of the river.
There was no car in sight.
I decided it would not be safe to wait so close to the safe zone, and started moving in the direction of the bridge.
One block behind me, a shadow left the safe zone.
I started running.
This was not good.
The road was a major one, with street lights and car traffic.
There would be not many sidetracks to the right.
The left was uphills, and towards the route from safe zone three.
I decided to increase the pace instead, and looked around.
The shadow was coming closer, as he had started to run as soon as he saw me getting away.
My pace was now at a level which I could keep up for a few blocks, and I started looking for escapes.
I began hearing the steps behind me.
I crossed the road, right before the oncoming traffic.
I had misjudged the drivers, who stopped to let both me and my chaser cross.
I sprinted.
I reached a delivery truck and zig-zagged behind the truck again on the other side.
He would not let loose.
The safe zone was one block ahead, enough to play the game once more.
But he was too close.
I stopped, panting.
I shouted \You win!'

 or just watch the whole video.'
The people are not speaking backwards, it's Hungarian.
After some fun-but-hectic signin (134 people signing things and grabbing for ribbons!
), I rushed off to checkpoint 3 - The Battery Park Labyrinth.
Alex and I had found an honest, hard-working oil lamp at a hardware store earlier that day, so that was my prop.
I sat down, took off my name tag, and set up and lit the lamp.
The unfortunate people who passed through first were at a disadvantage in that were looking for 'three girls' rather than 'a man with a lamp' - but I didn't know this at the time.
(the missing three were the original agents slotted for the checkpoint)  Being an agent is always a mixed bag - it's great talking to everyone as they pass through, but the down time can get to you.
Particularly as it gets later and colder, and the need of a bathroom becomes more immediate.
Anyway, no one decided to fuck with the guy with a lamp that night, but I did have one strange encounter.
Just as the last of the players were passing through, a man started playing guitar in the reedy flowers that led in to the labyrinth.
Pointing generally out to sea toward the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, he played pleasant strummy cords that got faded into the wind.
I couldn't tell if he was singing - I couldn't hear him singing, but I thought he was, for whatever reason.
A couple players passed by him.
Neither said anything to the other.
After ten minutes, he and I were alone as he continued strumming, and I paced while waiting for updates from Sam and Ian, and counting the minutes until I'd feel like I could leave (without leaving an empty checkpoint for someone).
Twenty minutes passed.
He stopped playing, checked a piece of paper on a bench, and then came back and continued.
I fixed the part of the fence some chaseees had knocked down.
He kept strumming.
I paced, carrying the lamp, sometimes deliberately skirting as close as I dared to the man - I wasn't sure he had even looked at me, yet.
I was paranoid enough by that point that I decided to dump the parfin from the lamp - what if the MTA had randomly searched my bag?
I packed up and walked down the path toward him.
By this point I had almost convinced myself that it must be Lou Reed or someone.
I passed by, said 'Have a good evening', and got only a cautious, upward half-nod in response.
Azure Armand and I recruited our friend Whthorse and together we formed the somewhat haphazard Team Spoon!
Along with close to 250 other people, we headed out from Dupont Circle into the night.
Our tactics - take indirect routes, avoid the Metro, be very paranoid - saw us through 5 out of 7 checkpoints.
The best costumes we saw along the way were those of Checkpoint 3, where scientists were studying Brownian motion.
Heading right down the middle of the Mall, we all reflected that DC is an awesome place to have an event like this.
We got jumped just after Checkpoint 5 by a very clever chaser who hid in a bus shelter.
We went on as chasers ourselves, but rather half-hearted ones who were, quite honestly, footsore and hungry.
So we had dinner at Ben's Chili along with many of the other participants, before continuing to the end of the night and the party.
The entire event was awesome.
The weather was perfect.
The people were cool.
The atmosphere was hilarious and tense and exciting and just fun!
We obviously didn't take it too seriously - we paused on the way to Checkpoint 5 to get some ice cream - but we had a lot of fun.
I think we ran and walked about 4 miles (especially with all of the doubling back we did to avoid chasers) all over DC.
Journey to the End of Los Angeles
The Pre-Journey
Loki, Lowteck, Lank and I made a raiding party in Lowteck's method of transportation to invade Los Angeles.
We piled into the station wagon and rolled on down central California, with a pit stop at le Taco Bell for nourishment.
Upon entering the fair city, we split up, for nefarious planning purposes.
Unfortunately, Lank's nefarious planning resulted in him needing to attend some sort of 'award show' where he was to receive some sort of 'award'.
All bumpkis, if you ask me.
I was held up by the lovely Nancy, who provided me with a remarkably comfortable couchspace and womanpower over at point 5.
The Journey
When I arrived at our arranged meeting point, it became quite clear that my skills would be most useful as a chaser, rather than a runner.
What helped this was that I was decked out in a stunningly large amount of red accessories, which actually was completely coincidental.
So I put on my red armband and took off with another chaser to stake out somewhere.
After some consideration, I removed all of the red paraphernalia from my body (minus, of course, my armband).
This proved quite effective - the runners were looking for my bright red suspenders.
I ended up telling them that all of this was on purpose.
all on purpose.
We parked by point 3 (the Hollywood Forever cemetery) and he trekked up to point 1 (Capitol Records Building) while I moseyed over to point 2 (Grauman's Chinese Theater).
Unfortunately, I had overestimated the speed of the runners and ended up beating not only the runners, but the checkpointman (Tom O'Tillo) hadn't even arrived.
This fact was actually not immediately apparent due to the fact that there were actually 3 pirates already in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater.
I worked my way to point 1 when I got a call from one of the other chasers, Lord Bojangles Winston-Jones.
Using his superpower (form of.
) he was able to capture one of the runners (hereafter Theresa).
Due to her not being equipped with bicycle superpowers, he dropped her off with me, and we quickly decided that we'd make it our mission to capture one Nazzo Tinerlen.
I suspect there might have been something inspiring this vendetta.
Tinerlen's prowess was already known amongst the chasers he was able to actually outrun Lord Bojangles.
Due to this, Theresa and I decided we needed to refuel.
We called up Mr.
Tinerlen and agreed to meet in the safe zone around point 2 for nourishment.
I got fudge.
Afternosh, we realized that we might have greater success getting on the Metro and heading straight for point 4.
We ended up meeting another chaser along the way (who's name I've forgotten - help?
The three of us decided to stake out Barnsdall park, and when we met up with the Check Pointers, we learned that no runner had yet made it there.
After a long, boring, yet somehow nerve-wracking stakeout, we were walking through a parking lot bordering the park.
We spotted Nazzo's trademark red hat, which we were told he'd never leave behind anywhere, and gave chase.
'There he is!
' It turned out to be a decoy Peter Garnett had sacrificed himself so that Nazzo might live.
But just up ahead, Nazzo Tinerlen was still in the lot and my companion gave chase.
When my companion ran out of breath and slowed down next to a car, Nazzo slowed as well, to look back and see me, still at full capacity.
I cried out.
He started running.
He turned a corner.
I turned the corner.
He was gone.
I looked all over, couldn't find him.
I yelled out 'He's disappeared!
' As I turned around, he popped out from behind a car and started sprinting away.
I got within two meters of him when he slipped into an open door in a parking garage and slammed it shut behind him.
They only open from the inside.
Much swearing was had.
We tried to surround the building, but it proved fruitless.
He was far too crafty and the building had far too many exits.
While scoping out the building, I ended up coming across Tac Haberdash and Rev.
Odyssius K.
Thwackinbusch.
I gave chase, and a fine one, considering my windedness from my previous pursuit.
I got fairly close, and they were tiring, but they bounded up into the garden around the medical center and I lost them.
My consolation was that apparently, while they were hiding, they almost fell into something marked 'Danger: Poison'.
Which means I almost killed them.
Is this a designated player-killing zone?
I'm afraid that there were no other exciting chases after this point.
We got down to point 5, then hunted around for a bit before finally settling in to the party at the finish line.
Team Bo Jackson Consisted of: 
Zak
Anya
Toom
Clan
Rydalia
Christina
Sam
June 23rd is a day that lives in infamy.
Not only was Journey to the end of the night part of this day, it was also the day that Toom was turning another year older.
Which managed to secure me some more friends out to this event?
I don't know why people are afraid of being chased, and afraid of running through SF for 4~5 hours.
Non-SF0 players Zak and his Girlfriend met up with me at my apartment and we got us a slice of pizza to sustain us for the eve's events.
We were in a taxi going like 80mph through union square to get to the ferry building.
We arrived, signed up as team Bo Jackson and hung out until the rest of our reinforcements arrived.
One of my oldest friends Christina was in town from Eureka, and another friend from High School Sam was in town, and I managed to get them on my piggyback for this adventure.
New SF0 member, Matt (player name Clan) met us shortly afterwards as well.
The game started and we were off!
I was spun around, completely retarded or both.
I ran my troupe the wrong direction.
Upon finding the first bus map I was like 'hey guys, down to Fremont street, the bus 10 runs us pretty darn close!
'
and then I noticed the time schedules on the bus (it was a post, not a bus stop) were a bit weather worn.
I hopped on the rail to reach up and bend the curled paper down to read it.
It only runs Monday through Friday!
The first big hike begins.
We avoided the stairwell (safezone) up to Coit tower, and instead were on the large paved streets that got increasingly steeper each block.
Our party member with Asthma was struggling a bit, but all in all it paid off as Agent Robinson was captured right there!
We were given 'get out of jail free' cards that were actually more useful than described.
Curse us for not reading the fine print until after the 6th stop!
Upon reaching the Coit tower (whewwww!
) we had some water and met 2 players (one of which is from my place of work).
Maggie and Lisa will be mentioned sooner, as they are an important part in the groups crumbling.
Ascending down Coit tower was easy.
It was a bit bottlenecked since going down any other way would take you behind the cliffs, making you do a lot more travel.
So into North Beach we went.
We started the 'scout' formation here.
With 1 person leading the group a good 20 feet or so ahead.
Trouble can be spotted by the scout and give the large group a few seconds of 'OH MY GOD RUN!
' and scatter opportunities.
We saw our first Chaser at one of the main north beach crossroads and I don't think he saw us!
We were soon climbing up Jackson street, with our checkpoint just 2 or 3 blocks ahead.
At the final crosswalk, a guy I recognize from other SF0 events runs up to use with a camcorder and a large backpack.
It was poon!
me: 'I recognize you!
therefore I don't trust you!
'
Him: 'oh!
Do you recognize my dog?
'
He spins around and shows us his tiny dog sticking out of the backpack.
me: 'That's cute'
Him: 'did you notice the collar?
'
At that moment, our entire group does an 'oh shit' in unison and bolts up the street towards 'the couple' on jackson street.
It was my friend Cam and his girly friend Al with her new cutey haircut.
Cam wishes me a happy birthday and says 'I got a gift for you!
'
Wanting to stay lightweight, I refuse 'give it to me later please.
I don't wanna carry it around!
'
'You'll want this.
' as he reaches into his bag and pulls out a Dasani Water.
FYI: Dasani is not a sponsor of this event.
I share the water with my group I thank Cam heartily and cut off a chunk of my ribbon to give to some late arrivals.
'Don't go up the hill.
'
'What?
'
Cam clarifies, 'Going up the hill is the shortest way to the next checkpoint.
consider it a birthday tip.
go down, and around.
And happy birthday!
'
I found out later that Cam was actually sending us into a trap, because my friend Orion wanted to give my group a good chase!
We had a slight change of plans as we went down the street.
A bus 30 was incoming and we just hopped right on it to Sutter Street.
Hooray for good timing!
Sam actually went over the hill because he wanted some more excitement.
Part of me wanted to go, but my group of almost all non-SF people would have been stranded.
Directly after getting off the bus, we saw another transfer bus!
a quick sprint secured us on a Bus 3 towards Hyde Street.
Our next tip was 'the Morton Salt Girl' and our next safezone was 'the CALA Foods parking lot'.
Since this is my neck of the woods now, I knew just where this CALA is.
We were talking about this on the bus, and when getting off, a lady told Zak 'goto the salt section inside the store'.
Which kinda freaked Zak out.
'How many people are involved in this game?
'
We used our scouting technique yet again to reach this parking lot.
No danger at all!
Inside CALA was a girl dressed up as the Mortonâ??s Salt girl with a shopping cart full of Mortonâ??s Salt.
She signed our sheet and told us to look for 'a man in an orange shirt reading'.
Still being in my neighborhood, I knew the best way there.
However, I've never done the walk with chasers out to get me.
Rounding our first corner out of the safezone.
I see Orion walking quickly towards me on the sidewalk.
'BACK TO THE SAFEZONE!
' I yell as my group bolts.
from there I had a small chit-chat session with Orion before he used his phone and tried to get reinforcements (which could have been fake.
)
We bolt down California Street at unsafe speeds and reach a bus stop on polk street to regroup.
Everyone was there cept for Zak!
(And Sam!
Sam had bravely distracted the nearby chasers by dangling his energy bar at them.
Then he nipped down Pine and never saw his team again.
)
Rydalia and Christina actually both got tagged and played their 'get out of jail free cards' and met up with us.
It appears Zak and his girlfriend were running from a chaser, rounded a corner and saw Maggie and Lisa (from Coit tower) in the distance.
They were being helpful and said 'don't go around the corner!
There are chasers!
'
From there, Maggie reached out and touched Zak and pointed at her Red band.
Zak was busted.
and our first loss of the night.
He was gonna try and get us at the next checkpoint, and we fell out of communication loop with him pretty much at this point.
We swung by my apartment (on the way to Japan Town.
stop 4) to drop layers of clothes, restroom and get some cold drinks.
I've never had such a good shot of Yager in my life.
As this has been in my freezer unopened for many months now.
Sam called us, asking for our location.
And I didn't want to trust him, since he could very well be a chaser now.
We told him we were on our way to stop 4, and he could meet us there.
Japan Town was SWARMING with evil-doers.
We Squatted in some bushes and behind some cars for a while just watching loiterers and people dressed in black patrol the entrance to the safezone.
Were they playing?
Were we just paranoid?
Eventually we saw Maggie and Lisa again, start walking down Post street towards the Richmond, and we made our move!
We figured they are far enough away.
We used our amazing scout system again, and I was taking the point.
A man dressed in all black with a backpack walked right past me.
I was trying to get eye contact with him, while still keeping an eye out for a red ribbon.
As soon as he passed me, he sprinted towards my group and managed to tag poor Karrin.
Who was now down at Fillmore and Geary of all places.
Christina was gone for a while but actually made it to Japantown when we thought we had lost her!
We went inside Denny's (the address!
) and saw another SF0 friend of mine Alan.
Not really reading, but conversing with a girl whom a broken leg in a booth.
We made our way to Laguna street and headed up to catch a Bus 1 to California and Parker.
According to nextbus.
com (on my cell phone.
is this cheating?
) we had 8 minutes to get to the top of a really steep hill!
We make it up, and I kinda sprinted because I had a lot of excess energy it seems.
Rydalia snapped another group picture here.
Bus was pretty much on time, and Rydalia (now tagged and not really playing, just traveling with us) was gonna make her way to the presidio checkpoint and she got off at the Masonic stop to get back into the game.
I gave her directions to catch the 43 bus, or walk up the hill towards checkpoint 6.
Rydalia sez in Tooms words: I waited for the bus, and eventually walked up to Jackson Street and met another player named Tom.
This is Tom!
Note from Toom to Rydalia: Add more stuff here!
Team Bo Jackson story continues: At California and Parker, we got our bearings and saw our safezone.
just a quick dash across the street.
A very quick dash.
Across a wide California street.
I yell 'GO GO GO!
' and we all sprint it.
at that moment a figure in a hood rounds the corner of the safezone.
an older man.
I want to say in his 60's!
I did however recognize him from the starting line!
'DON'T GO!
TURN AROUND' As we do a quick 180 and get back to our bus stop safezone.
We watch the old man cross the street and walk past us, like we weren't even there.
We resprint, and make it with no real challenge.
We knock on the door to the address, and enter one of the nicest San Francisco Apartments I've ever been in.
We get our signature and are asked to write our life story in 10 words or less into a piece of scrap paper and put it into a bag.
Mine was almost too serious, and I don't feel like sharing it.
We march our way out and are planning to catch the same bus (10 mins or so away says nextbus.
com)
A few Steps after we leave the safezone, footsteps from behind us.
Out of the safezone, a chaser emerges and almost grabs Christina, but thanks to some very limber moves, she dodges the hand by a few inches before running back into the safezone.
I start sprinting to the bus stop at the end of the block and I hear the footsteps behind me.
No idea if they are getting closer, but I just keep running.
My first real sprint of the game.
I make it to the stop and the guy slows down.
we laugh at each other and he says 'nice run!
' and walks down California.
I signal my group, and they join me as we wait for the bus.
Hopping back into the fray at Presidio/Masonic (where Rydalia was dropped off) we make our way up Presidio Avenue and head into the heart of the wilderness of the presidio.
Approaching Jackson street I see a familiar figure.
A hooded Man.
Wait a second.
it's the same old man in his 60's!
When I ran from him last time, he didn't chase me, but he didn't signal that he is blue either!
Maybe he is just old and unable to run, and uses his oldness as a handicap to get close to players and then just touches them and laughs as he collects more blue ribbons!
I try not to alert my group and I keep eye contact on him as he just walks slowly past us.
How did he get there before us?
confusing.
and why was he walking the wrong way?
Rydalia's side in Toom's words
After waiting a long time For the bus 43 at Jackson and presidio with new travel companion, 'Tom'.
An old man in a black hoodie also approached me and said that he is going to go home because his car will get stolen down at the ferry building.
Rydalia and Tom#2 adventured into the presidio after the 43 bus drove by and didn't stop for us, even though we were waving/signaling!
Team  Bo Jackson story Continues:
Walking on the well lit road we realize we should cut through the wilderness into the darker residential areas ahead.
What seemed like a good idea was a failed lesson in stealth.
Crushing shrubbery and stumbling through brush seemed to put a large 'WE ARE OVER HERE' sign on our heads.
Since the map we were given didn't have much detail on the presidio section, we were trying to find our location by best guess.
Good thing we are right near Morton Street Field, where I play ultimate Frisbee every Wednesday and Friday at 12:15 to 1:30.
Walk-ins welcome to the game, FYI!
We tip toed through a foot trail staying in the dark and started hearing a lot of chatter.
Rydalia called me up as we were doing our best to sneak.
She said she was at the checkpoint drinking whiskey.
I asked her to fake cough loudly.
and sure enough my entire group heard the cough.
As I scout out the short path ahead a hooded figure emerges down the road behind me, and I slowly increase my walk speed towards the checkpoint.
The figure appears to be Josh, from team eXXXtreme!
I signal my group it's clear and we all reunite.
sans Sam and Zak and Anya.
Smile Toom!
You are drinking Johnny Walker!
Rydalia decides to join us for the walk to the finish line.
This is where Team Bo Jackson met Tom#2.
He joined our final walk to the finish line.
the Wave Organ.
We strutted our funky stuff through the Lucas Empire, and ended up hitting Marina Blvd by going under the freeway.
From there we relayed with Cam and Al, who if you recall were working checkpoint #2.
A quick chat, and then our final approach was in sight.
At this point we read the fine print of our 'get out of jail free cards' and now knew it was a 'freeze all chasers for 60 seconds'!
So we slowly made our walk to the finish line, with safety card in tow.
Any sign of danger, we will freeze em for a minute, and we had 3 more of these cards just in case we had additional problems.
Rydalia was getting so sore from the sprinting, I ended up giving her a piggyback for a good chunk of the final walk.
Good thing I had so much energy/adrenaline.
No threats or no dangers got us to the checkpoint where Chaser Orion greeted us and congratulated us.
Out finishing time was about 12:30 am i'd wager.
Sam was already there ahead of us, and never got caught!
good on him!
Since I was in shorts and a T-shirt, sitting down at the finish line was absurdly cold.
Moving around at fast speeds seemed to work quite well with me, but once it slowed down I wanted a bullet in my brain.
Preferably the part of my brain that tells my body that it is cold.
We took off shortly after we got there.
in a hobble since our muscles got to relax at the finish line and restarting the movement was not a good feeling.
Team Bo Jackson walked up to Lombard and caught a Taxi to Grubstake where dinner was had by all.
Clan had a mushroom and cheddar omelet
Toom had a Ham and Jack Omelet
Christina had a BLT
and Rydalia had a Cheeseburger with French fries.
Man, I remember a lot of Misc shit.
I orchestrated the event (with Ian and Sean) from the starting and ending points.
There were some minor snags, like getting kicked off the steps of the Federal Building by the Police (it's a sensitive area, or something), but all in all it went great.
The winner, Brian, completed the night break-neck speed style, finishing in about 1.
Here are some pics taken at the ending point.
More to follow!
please note the homemade trophy the winner received.
it is made from garbage found on the street nailed to other garbage found on the street.
during that night i was within a solid structure
but had the experience of total freedom.
this is a state i cherish, and am seeking.
What an epic night.
Team FoeCakes started out as maybe 20 people who all started the race together.
A few blocks of sprinting later and the team had dispersed.
A lot of us made it to the first checkpoint together and then we headed down the safe zone.
We came to the final block of the safe zone and I said I would go scout an alternate route through a cabbie junkyard.
I got to the end of it and found a suitable alley to follow and turned around.
Where did the team go?
Rex and jumpinâ?? jane flash were there, but no one else was.
Thatâ??s the last time I scout for them!
I got a call from Gremlin and met up with her and Kevin and somehow lost Rex and jumpinâ?? jane flash.
Then a chaser on a bike spotted us.
We all ran for it.
Gremlin and Kevin back to the safe zone, the logical thing to do.
I ran across the street, hoping the median would keep the biker from following me.
She went for Gremlin and Kevin.
Excellent, my plan worked.
Wait, now Iâ??m stuck in this little alcove with an apartment door and the chaser is circling back aroundâ?¦ So I did what anyone whoâ??s a fan of spy novels would do: I pretended to be fumbling with my keys in the apartment door, my back to the street.
My heart was pounding in my chest.
If the chaser saw me, I was done for.
I heard the whir of the bike as it sped past.
(This little story won me the gold metal at the end of the night for best story in 10 words or less.
The Story: I pretended it was my apartment and lost the chaser.
)
After that close call I met up with Gremlin and Kevin again and we started the long haul through various alleys and 1 hobo path to the next checkpoint.
We met little resistance as we went.
A block from the safe zone of checkpoint 2, we decided to let a group of 3 runners go in front of us to act as bait and flush the chasers.
But as they passed us, we realized it was meredithian, Mr.
G, and Sparrows Fall, all members of team FoeCakes.
So we joined forces and a few steps later, were scattered when an UNMARKED chaser ran after us.
Some of us managed to escape into the subway.
We sent a few other runners up ahead of us as bait and then made a made dash for the safe zone.
We ended up waiting for Gremlin to rejoin us there and headed for the blue line.
Incidentally, this was the 1 and only time we took a train and it was only for 1 stop.
My poor CTA card must have felt cheated.
We got off the train and headed for Lower Wacker Drive.
â??Is there a pedestrian walkway on Lower Wacker?
â?
â??I donâ??t know.
Letâ??s go!
â?
Lower Wacker Jaunt
More Lower Wacker Jaunting

We found a service driveway and kept to that, stopping to check out some thugs ahead and make sure they werenâ??t chasers.
They werenâ??t, but the 2 people lazily heading towards us were.
After scattering again, we all somehow managed to avoid the chasers and meet up again at checkpoint 3.
We promptly got separated again, heading for checkpoint 4.
Gremlin and I stayed with Rex and jumpinâ?? jane flash after a pit stop to Walgreens.
We decided to take the direct route of Michigan Ave and tried to blend in with the crowd of tourists.
We did this so well that one homeless man didnâ??t believe us when we said we were from Chicago.
Mission: Accomplished.
One block from checkpoint 4, we lost Cara to exhaustion.
We once again met up with our cohorts and headed for checkpoint 5, possibly the most harrowing part of our journey.
We went way out of the way to avoid the chasers (this was the theme of the night).
This plan worked well until we were once again a block from the safe zone.
Kevin and meredithian went running off in different directions and the rest of us headed down into an underground parking garage.
â??Thatâ??s a private driveway!
â?
â??No through traffic!
â?
â??For cars, not people!
â?
We got the end of the garage and spotted a 4 foot cement wall that wasnâ??t fenced off, but decided to try the entrance ramp back up to street level instead.
A few of us scouted it out and promptly ran back in the other direction, after seeing 5 chasers laying in wait.
They followed and one by one, we all jumped the cement wall and ended up next to train tracks and running through gravel and debris until we made out way up to street level.
Definitely the highlight of my night.
View from above of the wall we jumped.
There was simply no time during the escape to stop for a photo op.
Some of us were separated and made another dash when more chasers followed.
We ran behind a bank building and made a new plan.
It was right out of Saving Private Ryan.
Gremlin, Rex, Sparrows Fall and I decided the only thing to do was make a mad dash for the safe zone, hoping one of us survived.
Weâ??d do it as a team or not at all.
We pumped ourselves up, made our peace, then emergedâ?¦only to find that all the chasers had disappeared and our path to the safe zone was clear.
How anticlimactic!
Checkpoint 5 Confusion

After regrouping at the checkpoint, we set off for the final leg.
We once again, went WAY out of the way to get to Balbo to cross Lake Shore Drive.
Paranoia was high, but we met no resistance.
Our legs were just about to give out when we timed our movements to make the walk signal across LSD and found ourselves in the final safe zone!
I couldnâ??t believe we had survived.
And it only took 5 hoursâ?¦
Some of Team FoeCakes give the cupcakes what's coming to 'em.
Itâ??s Thursday and Iâ??m only now not limping around because of the horrible shin splints.
A Saturday night well spent!
Thanks Dax and all the volunteers for making this one of the most memorable nights in Chicago!
I think my favorite part was getting to explore parts of the city I might not otherwise go and to look at the streets from a very different perspective.
That of a runner.
Though not generally recognizable, (arguably playing a different character) I served as the proctor for the circle of peace.
I chose to wear coveralls and carry a broom and traffic cone as a reference to.
well actually nothing except that I thought I might look official to any potential muggers etc.
I wonder if anyone has a picture of either me or at least the circle w/ illuminated cone?
I was dropped off at the circle of peace at least an hour before anyone arrived.
This hour was spent waiting and phoning people trying to determine if anything was happening.
The most notable things that happened were as follows:
one group of two guys and girl asking me, \Is the wierd moaning guy lying the path back there a chaser?'
) Then asking me which was the best way to get out of the park without getting mugged.
(I had been feeling relatively safe until then.
)
a large later group that crept silently out of the bushes all together like a special forces team completely suprising Ian and I.
I was amused when Vlad and Kelly  (I think it was them) told me they hid for 15min from  a couple having a picnic.
Finally, one of the last groups was insistent (totally unprompted) that they had almost figured out the secret inspirations for all the costumes at the various checkpoints.
I already mentioned that I wasn't supposed to 'be' anything but - great stuff - way to develop the narrative.
Maybe that team could tell us all what their conclusion was I believe Ian's parents were \Mr.'
(whatever that is).
Also apparently there was a homeless man sleeping in the Shakespeare garden that kept asking people to close his gate.
All in all, once people started coming through it was a fun night.
I was especially taken by how 'serious' people were about the 'game.
'  
Cheers to all the participants.
I hope everyone enjoyed themselves.
Unfortunately I didn't really get a chance to meet anyone but I'm sure that will remedy itself as the summer goes on.
Oh, Journey, how I love you.
(Lengthy text incoming, as always.
)
Every time I've attended a Journey, it's always been a journey, literally.
I've debated throwing one together in St.
Louis, where I live, but the city dynamics just don't really work for it at the moment.
So, I've settled with traveling to them when they arise and I'm able.
For this Journey, I was hauling my beloved bike up from St.
Louis to Chicago.
I was quite excited about this.
I've never had the chance to be a bike chaser, and I was more then happy to take it.
Bike chasing seemed to be something more exciting then just chasing.
Not because you have a speed 'advantage', but more because of the terror a chaser on a bike can inspire.
I got into town Friday evening, got my things put away and organized, and hung out for a bit.
I declined on drinks for the most part that evening, as I learned my lesson when I ran a Journey the day after my birthday once.
Showing up at the starting line with a kicking hangover is normally not a good idea.
Saturday, game day.
I woke early, got the things I'd need together and threw them in my backpack.
I jumped on my bike and toured the route so I'd have a basic feel for it, since I don't live in Chicago and the directions wouldn't just come to me.
After taking my tour, I headed north to Logan Square to hang out with Dax and Allison pre-game.
We hung out for a bit, then split, as Dax headed one way, and Allison and I went to meet up with a couple of the other chasers.
From there, we headed to the start for a pre-Journey staff meeting and planning.
We started discussing staff-chaser placement, and solidifying plans when we noticed that players were starting to show up already.
Voices were lowered and eventually we had everything laid out.
Most of our Chasers headed out into the field to lay in wait, while myself and the Tennis Player (Referred to as Track Star in other Praxi) stayed at the start.
The amount of people that ended up showing caused a bit of confusion at the start.
We were short some materials, people kept tugging my arm, begging for blue and pink bands so they could play, maps so they could get them signed.
Game time was soon, and Dax implored people to cut their bands in half and share with some so we had enough.
I ran around the starting grounds picking players and asking them for half their bands until we finally came up with enough.
Dax called for them to start while I was still handing out a few more ribbons, so myself, and a few of the runners got a bit of a late start.
Everyone seemed to scatter in the same direction from the start.
I watched as I handed out the last few ribbons and then jumped on my bike.
Checkpoint one wasn't very far, and I didn't want it to be completely uneventful for everyone.
I ignored the runners that got a late start due to not having armbands, as it seemed only fair.
Biking past them I came upon the groups of people that had stopped running already, apparently not seeing a reason to run yet.
A few of them turned and saw me, and beginning running, but the two that interested me were the two that were just calmly walking down the bridge like they had no care in the world.
I biked up right alongside of them and looked over before they finally jumped realizing I was a chaser.
Not wanting someone to go out of the game so early, and so easy, I asked them if they really thought they'd make it halfway playing like this, and took off after a group that started running when they saw me.
The runners were using everything they could to their advantage right away, which I loved.
Sprinting towards stairs, getting off of concrete and into grass, darting through bushes, making sharp, quick turns away from me, and trying their best to nullify my speed advantage.
My competitive spirit took over, and the only challenge they threw at me that I wasn't willing to tackle was taking my bike, which is meant to only be on roads, down flights of stairs.
I chased them through grass with no question, I hopped off and on curbs just as quickly as they did, and when they quickly changed directions, I'd mash my rear brake and slid my rear wheel around to be facing their direction again in moments.
I was chasing them with determination.
but little did most of them know, I wasn't really attempting to tag any of them yet.
I'd pretend the grass was slowing me down more then it really was, I'd reach for them but \miss\'
As I biked further down the street I encountered a couple on the sidewalk.
At this point there was a fence between us, so I couldn't really get to them.
When they noticed me, they looked startled for a moment, but I reassured them that I couldn't fly and continued on.
The fence opened up further down the road and I did a dramatic skid stop onto the sidewalk, looking at them further up the sidewalk while sitting still.
They immediately looked at each other and took off.
I biked towards them and they ran into a tennis court enclosure but left the door open, so I biked in after them.
One of them went out the left side and shut the door behind him, so I chased the other into the left side, until she did the same.
It was an amusing chase, and I let them go as I headed towards the checkpoint.
As I closed on checkpoint 1, I chased a few of the runners into the checkpoint with those already safe cheering them on.
Then I circled around to the front of the checkpoint and addressed all the runners with a yell.
\I've been being really nice to you guys in between the start and the first checkpoint.'
This next part is fairly comical considering the declaration I just made.
After stating that, I bike towards a player sitting on the corner not paying attention.
I slowly come up behind him, with my hand out, just waiting for it to touch him when he hears the players at the checkpoint yelling for him to run.
He turns and sees me just in time, missing my tag by inches, and takes off.
I let him go, and hopped the curb to get onto the street and hassle some of the runners heading towards checkpoint 2, but the lights weren't in my favor so I turned around to hassle people coming to and leaving 1 still.
As I did so I went to chase one person and the way I was riding my bike finally caught up to me.
It seems a bike meant to be rode on the streets doesn't like taking jumps, hoping curbs, and generally riding it like it was a mountain bike.
I went off a sidewalk after someone and shortly after noticed my back tire had blew.
I was quite upset, so early in the game, for this to happen.
Though it truly was my fault, I shouldn't have been riding it like that.
I had to dejectedly walk my bike to CP1 and make a call to Dax informing him what had happened, and that I had to walk my bike to CP4 where my bag and lock was.
This took me out of the game for a bit.
Everyone at CP1 that just heard me tell them I wasn't going to be so nice in chasing them anymore I'm sure had a bit of a chuckle, and some relief.
I actually ended up popping a spoke out also, which un-trued my wheel quite a bit.
proof:1, size:100, align:left












From here I walked my bike to CP4.
On the way I kept seeing runners scatter from me and I was sad that I couldn't chase them.
I didn't want to set my bike down and risk it getting stolen, and running with it I'd never catch anyone.
I felt really bad, because I don't think most of them knew my tire was flat, so they probably just thought I didn't care to chase them, which might have taken away part of the fun until they got to chasers that actually started to chase them.
I also ran into a group of runners sitting inside a CTA station.
I had to walk right by them so I couldn't pass the chance to screw with them a little bit.
I walked my bike into the station and asked them if they wanted to ride the train together.
They were quite nice, and I told them I actually had to get to 4 for my bike lock since my tire blew.
They directed me towards an air pump, which I headed towards for a moment, until I realized it wouldn't help since I didn't have patches on me.
I reassured them that I wasn't going to chase them as they left, since it wasn't worth ruining my rim, or risking my bike getting stolen and was on my way.
I finally made it to four, talked with the Animus, locked my bike up, grabbed a drink, and stalked the first runner I saw that made it there.
I was a bit upset about my bike and this poor guy was getting the brunt of it.
I watched him get his manifest signed, and jog off, so I started jogging along a side street in the same direction.
He paused on a corner to ask directions and I slowly walked up to the corner, as I had a pole for cover in between us.
Eventually I had to come around the pole, and he noticed me, but it was too late, I was right on top of him.
The poor guy jumped back from the tag and into the people he was asking for directions.
We both apologized to them, and headed back to CP4.
I hung around there for a minute, deciding what I wanted to do with my bike, when Megin came alone with patches to save the day.
After getting my bike fixed (Patched, couldn't fix the spoke, but it was able to be rode), Megin and I patrolled around between  four and the finish looking for players.
We covered a ton of ground but weren't really finding a lot of players.
Eventually, after we'd been gone from the finish for a while and no more players had made it in, we decided many more couldn't be left and called it a night.
That was at 17 players finished.
In the end 54 players finished!
I'm a bit sad I stopped when there were so many more left, but I'm sure there were enough player chasers to keep them occupied anyway.
Apologies for the lack of pictures, I don't tend to pause for them during Journey.
All I can really do is snap a picture of my bicycle damage now and post it along with.
I can also mention that my local bike shop lectured me about proper usage of my bicycle.
The route towards the first check point wasn't terribly difficult to navigate.
The only chasers we saw were on bikes, so we used this to our advantage.
We would cut through trashed lots and residential neighborhoods.
At one point, we cut through a dog park.
A lady with a boxer, grabbed her dog's collar, and told us to hurry because her dog was getting riled up.
The lady was totally bluffing, and was just a irritable yuppie.
Anyways, I won't digress.
The next two check points were traversed by using strategic buses.
It seemed like the majority of the passengers on the bus were playing Journey.
There wasn't too many close encounters with chasers, for those checkpoints.
The fourth was entirely different, though.
First, one of my friends fell to a track star, under I-290- I believe.
Then, the second we laid eyes on Chinatown, it was trouble.
My friend, Dan, and I were in a parking lot with a bush/fence in front of us- when we locked eyes with a chaser.
Then, all of us froze, ready to draw.
I faked left and then squeezed right past the bush.
The chased tagged Dan, and let me take off while she shouted to the other chasers.
First, I passed a chaser daydreaming at a bus stop.
They cursed to themselves, and then started after me.
Next, I passed another chaser who was off guard.
They joined the chase, and so did 2-3 others that tried to flank me.
I kept down archer with all these chasers pursuing me.
I've never ran so hard.
Except maybe from the police.
Eventually some hermes-like chaser caught up to me and tagged me.
When I turned there were four others with him and a couple in the distance that gave up trying to compete with the others.
I think that at one point, I had 6-7 chasers after me.
Little did I know, I was only across the street from the checkpoint.
I'm not disappointed by that either.
In fact, I'm proud by how I went down.
I'm glad it took 7 of you mofos to take me down.
I'll make you work for my virgin ass!
(absolutely no details are given to the locations of occurrences during this pursuit, due largely to the utter lack of spatial orientation on part of the author)
PRELUDE
This would be my first foray into Journey To The End Of The Night in San Francisco, or any large scale city-wide game for that matter.
I didn't know what to expect from such a thing, knowing only that I ought to be prepared to have my eyes opened by what the masses had to offer me.
As a sort of inauguration celebration into this new world, the Western Bacon Blue Ring from Taylor's Automatic Refresher would serve as my fuel for the evening to come.
CHAPTER 1 - CRITICAL MASS
We figured that arriving at 1900hrs would be important, to make sure that we didn't miss out on anything critical.
We were disappointed (yet impressed) by the large line that welcomed us disappointed that we had to wait, but impressed by both the large number and relative orderliness with which everybody waited.
The time waiting for the game to being was spent enjoying the sights of everybody's costumes: Santa Claus, Jesus, rubick's cube (how ever will she run with her arms tucked in?
), a coconut drink, various ninjas, a cyborg (apparently cyborgs of the future will look like humans with random PCBs and boards tied around them), and other such misfits.
I determined at that moment that, as a result of my lack of costume and getting into it-edness, I would compensate with my zeal for the game.
CHAPTER 2 - LET THE GAMES BEGIN
As the crowd gathered to critical mass and gave itself a mind of its own, there was little to be done about the start of the game as huge swarms began to move.
As we began our all out sprint we couldn't help but notice the small but significant crowd beginning a count down.
What's this?
We can't start without being part of the countdown!
and the pursuit begins!
Caught up in the euphoria of the crowd and being part of the critical mass, the cop car we are rushing towards as we sprint down the middle of the street gives me little pause.
The game is on.
For moments my mind is consumed by the fact that I am now running through the streets of San Francisco, in a game with an untold number of other people, with nothing but some instructions to find the location of the circled number on the map.
CHAPTER 3 - SUPERNOVA
The journey to the first checkpoint is largely uneventful, mostly just filled with bursts of excitement at the novelty of the game and the sheer craziness that is occurring around me.
We manage to find a rather competent looking fellow hereby titled Supernova (out of reverence to his blue cape with the words \Super Nova\' on it).'
We would attempt to travel to the first checkpoint with our new friend Supernova, in hopes that the combined competence and know-how (plus numbers) would deliver us safely.
The most fun during this part was creating random panic with our fellow runners.
It doesn't take much more than a determined run, and a couple yells of \chasers\' to create a fury of movement not unlike a flock of pigeons being chased by some overzealous toddler.'
It was an enjoyable sight to see, though was coupled with the difficulty of managing to get close enough to the runners to explain to them that they needed fear me not.
We did also meet one other suspicious crowd that seemed to be aware and diligent with the goals of the game but lacking in the armbands.
Apparently due to the shortage of armbands, this crowd had decided to employ the classic sacrificial-friends strategy and have those not in the game protect the few that were.
Since we will be seeing this group again in a later chapter, we shall call them the Adelie Penguins (names not for their costumes, but the tactics these penguins use to protect themselves by forming small groups).
CHAPTER 4 - ADELIE PENGUINS
The sense of success at arriving at the first checkpoint safely also brought the somber realization that we had lost Supernova in the celebrations.
Alas, we were left with little choice to look for another group, to which Adelie Penguins seemed like a suitable candidate.
Though it would only be a little while longer before realizing that these penguins did not wobble like those on shows, but were indeed too fast and swift for our group to maintain pace with.
Abandoned along the streets of San Francisco with no protection but our own wits to fend for ourselves, we went along our way in search on the second checkpoint.
Having made some fair progress with the Adelie Penguins, we soon found ourselves at the threshold of the second safe zone, but with a dilemma.
Apparently there was a homeles.
what's that?
It's his costume?
That seemingly homeless man is actually a chaser waiting for his next target!
Alarming how an innocently looking man wandering back and forth aimlessly at an empty traffic light could end up being such a concern.
The only refuge we could take in the situation is that he had set his eyes on another prey, providing us with a nice path to the second checkpoint.
CHAPTER 5 - FREEDOM
The second checkpoint was full of eager runners waiting to get their manifests signed.
The caused some mumblings within a group, trying to determine whether it best to continue on and make progress while staying within the spirit of the game, or to have our manifests signed and continue staying legit.
In the end the obedient got the best of us and we had our manifests signed.
Fortunately this gave us the opportunity to meet the Money-you-called-be-saving-with-Geico man and also the Bay-bridge-collapsed lady.
The time lost at the second checkpoint however, would bring our eventual demise.
It appeared as if all exists out of the safety zone had been entirely blocked off but chasers who were nothing but eager to have others join their fold.
Only a mostly unnoticed alleyway provided an escape for us to quietly slip past the eyes searching for their next prey.
But alas, our victory would be short lived.
Stopping only for moment to determine our next action, our chaser had managed to pounce upon us, leaving little time for reaction before the lot of them had scattered our crowd.
I had no chance in the confusion, and was the first to be caught during my attempts to guide our team to safety.
But one cannot deny the sense of freedom and relief that occurs at the fateful moment when all that you have feared comes to pass.
There was an almost poetic sense of peace knowing that I, once a runner, was now a chaser invulnerable to anything except for the cars that constantly honked their horns at the random people running through the streets.
CHAPTER 6 - PENGUIN'S SECOND LIFE
It seemed all too sweet to be able to walk the streets with no fear.
It mattered not that I was walking through the questionable neighbourhoods in SF, for I was a chaser, and I was now invincible.
Nothing could make me much happier than to enjoy the pursuit of bringing down a runner into my realm.
But what better luck than to have the Adelie Penguins reappear as prime targets.
This would also serve my curiosity into the effectiveness of their defense mechanism.
And so it is with great concern that I worry over the survivability of Adelie penguins everywhere.
For the chase was short, and the true Adelie Penguin was swiftly brought down.
Apparently the whole theory stands little chance when the predator is quick and swift enough to weave through the crowd and quickly locate his prey.
But I can take solace in the fact that, as a result of incessant pleading on part of the penguins, they were allowed to continue another day as I gave them their runner band back.
Though it was through an initial sense of kindness at keeping this happy little pack together that I did it, inwardly I could not deny the excitement of the chase through the Penguin flock again sometime in the hopeful future.
CHAPTER 7 - STARVING FOR RUNNERS
Having your whole existence being determined by the availability of prey inevitably does have its downfall.
namely what to do when you don't know where your prey is.
In hopes of cutting off the runners from the front, our ingenious plot would be to skip one checkpoint so that we could blissfully meet (and catch) wave after wave of runner from the front as they approached their fifth checkpoint.
However, little did we foresee the slaughter of runners to such a degree that their prey were left wanting.
With seemingly few runners left in the game, and little hope of more action, we began our retreat back to the lives we had left a little while ago.
Leaving the game could not erase the joys of both being chased and chasing.
Despite our resolve to leave the game, intermittent sightings of runners would send us in hot pursuit in attempts to once again relive the dream of catching a runner.
Our first attempt brought us to a formidable foe who was both fast and had endurance, providing much too big of a challenge for what little I could muster.
It was only later on that I had learnt he had eventually been caught, though only after running from three chasers subsequently with no break in between.
The second attempt however was one of sweetness.
A two for one pursuit in which one was brought down, the runner ribbon acquired, and then the second brought down soon after in close vicinity after a short-lived chase.
Alas, this would serve as my last act of the night, to bring two down.
a glorious ending.
EPILOGUE
I got on the BART.
Went home.
And slept.
what more do you want of me?
Though I've heard about the event for two years now, this was my first time attending (and playing as a runner).
I was recovering from a slight cold, and still not entirely over it.
but since this was a once a year event, I decided I couldn't miss it.
And so I showed up, with a pocketful of Kleenex and a pretty loud, persistent cough.
Ready to play.
Below is the blog entry I wrote, soon after I participated in the event.
Hoping it's ok to sort of copy/paste it here, instead of writing it anew.
---------
Originally posted on avoision.
On Saturday I participated in Journey to the End of the Night - an urban street game that consists of a large group of \runners
However - here's the catch: if you're a runner and you're tagged you immediately become a chaser.
Similar to how things work with zombies, the longer things go on.
the worse it gets.
As the night/game progresses, it becomes harder and harder to get past all the chasers.
The event began in Welles Park, where folks gathered to register.
The official start time was at 7:00PM, but people were encouraged to show up early (and I understood why, once we arrived).
Liz was kind enough to drive both me and Jake over, and hung out with us while we were waiting in line.
Walking near the registration point.
While taking a photo of the sign, I started to get pretty excited/nervous to play.
There were a LOT of people already queued up.
I'm glad we showed up when we did, because the folks just kept on a-coming.
Paul met us in line and we slowly made our way to the registration tables.
Looking out over the area in front of the gazebo, registered runners were milling about discussing strategy.
Near the top of the gazebo ramp, looking back at the folks still in line.
A perfect image for the game.
Note the Red and Blue ribbons on the table (red = chasers, blue = runners).
Each person gets two ribbons on registering.
Ribbons must be worn on the upper part of the arm and made visible at all times.
You put on the blue ribbon to signify you're a runner you put the red ribbon in your pocket.
If, during the event, you are tagged by a chaser.
you hand that person your blue ribbon (it counts as their \kill\').'
You then put on the red ribbon and play the rest of the game as a \chaser.'
Evan's wife Shama, one of the main organizers of the event.
She was super busy directing people and blocking folks from directly walking up to the gazebo to register.
I said a quick hello and joked about how I hoped I wouldn't see Evan later (he was a chaser).
Me, Jake and Paul, studying our maps.
I love how totally serious and focused we are.
The three of us discussing strategies.
The event has to be tackled in order, with runners hitting each of the checkpoints in order (there were 6 checkpoints in all).
For checkpoints 1 and 2, there were two options for each (1A/1B and 2A/2B).
Additionally, there were two spots marked with a \?'
These were not mandatory checkpoints, but there was something special for those who sought them out.
Since this was a safe zone between checkpoints 2 and 3, we decided we needed to stop by.
One of the other organizers, giving out some instructions to the folks still in line.
I should note that from here on out, all the photos are from my cellphone (I had given my camera to Liz, who had taken off for home).
I was debating bringing my camera along with me, but looking back on things - I'm really glad I didn't.
It would have been near impossible to run with that thing, and ultimately it was a tradeoff: mobility over photography.
I'm bummed Liz had to go home, but she was coming down with whatever illness I got (and still had).
While my cough was improving, it still was pretty present and I remember hacking a lot even before the running began.
You know those Nature documentaries where they focus on lions hiding in the tall grass, with a large group of gazelles nearby?
And how there's usually a baby gazelle, newly born, who's falling down frequently due to its shaky new legs?
The baby gazelle is pretty much what I felt like.
I didn't have a lot of optimism for my chances.
Don't Tag Me, Bro!
Near 7:30 PM, the crowd was called in for some last minute instructions.
I'm always terrible when trying to estimate crowds, but I'd say there were maybe 500 folks stamping their feet, trying to stay warm, and ready to run.
The excitement was very much in the air, with a few false starts.
About 25 people began running too early, with the rest of the crowd yelling at them to come back (lots of Boo's).
Originally Jake, Paul and I were going to take things at an easy pace (none of us really wanted to run much).
We were going to make our way down alleys and work on not being spotted.
When we saw how many people there were, and realize that most folks would be hauling ass out of the park the moment things began.
we decided we needed to get moving as fast as possible.
I couldn't hear very well, but I believe there was something about how the runners were only being given a 5 second head start.
That said, I didn't see any chasers until we hit checkpoint 2.
I have an unverified theory that there are no chasers stationed between the start and the first checkpoint, mostly as a motivational thing to ensure that everyone gets to at least one checkpoint.
Not sure about that though.
A blurry shot of us going down an alley.
Our initial plan of being hidden worked out well, but took us way out of the way.
We spent a LOT of time going through alleys and didn't arrive at the first checkpoint until more than an hour later.
After backtracking a bit, we finally arrived at the first checkpoint (1A), in Winnemac Park.
As we approached, the checkpoint consisted of a small area, crisscrossed with police/caution tape.
There were two guys at the entrance, wearing hazmat suits and carrying light wands.
As each person approached, they did a quick fake \scan\' of every runner and gave them a password.'
People then had to go into the tangle of tape and find another volunteer to be de-contaminated.
As I was making my way through the tape, I heard someone behind me yell out my name.
I turned around and saw two girls, who were also midway through the tape.
The girl who called me was named Jen, and she was with her friend Chrissy.
Turns out Jen recognized me from my time as a contestant for Month at the Museum.
Not only that, she's also a MeFite!
I have to admit, it was both pretty eerie and pretty awesome to have a stranger recognize you.
I only had it happen once or twice, when the MATM event was going on.
and it still happens (infrequently) from time to time.
I wanted to stick around a chat a bit more, but Paul and Jake were already done with their checkins and were waiting around for me.
Additionally, given how much time we blew getting to the first checkpoint.
I felt like we were at the tail end of the race.
So I wanted to keep the pace up.
After a very hurried greeting, I turned around and got my map stamped.
The woman asked me for the password I was given, and I totally blanked.
I was afraid I'd have to go back through the tape, get a new password, and return - possibly losing even more time.
I took a guess and remembered correctly, got my signature and was off.
More alleys.
At this point, the sun had begun to set and it got harder to see arm bands.
As the night continued, you had to rely more on body movements to determine if people were runners or chasers (or even playing the game at all).
It installed a very interesting sense of ever-present paranoia.
In getting to the next checkpoint, Jake recommended we hop a wall and sneak through Rosehill Cemetery.
On nearing the wall, I think there was a small panic as a group of people showed up behind us.
Some folks started to run, and it seemed like we were being chased (but we weren't).
Jake bolted across the street, climbed up a tree and was over the wall in the blink of an eye.
Paul and I, moving slower once we realized there were no chasers, eventually made our way to the wall.
I'm not 100%, but I think this is near where we were.
I tried climbing up, but slipped and slid back down the tree, scratching my arms up.
Paul was able to get over and, on my second attempt, I was able to as well.
We found ourselves inside Rosehill Cemetery, with not much light left in the sky.
Jake was long gone, and so Paul and I started to slowly make our way through, keeping the wall to our right the whole time.
Jake called and text us, and spoke with Paul about how to get out (apparently, Jake really knew this cemetery well).
A blurry shot, taken inside the cemetery.
As we were walking, the walls got taller and taller and taller.
As we kept going, I was on the lookout for the exit that Jake claimed was nearby.
I began getting concerned, thinking we were effectively trapped inside the cemetery, with no real way out.
The walls were way too tall to climb over, and with the darkness.
I couldn't see any clear exit.
Paul got on the phone with Jake, who directed us to the corner of the cemetery.
There was a small squared off area, marked by a wooden door/gate.
Inside, there was a patch of land that was just strewn with some pretty big weeds (some taller than us).
When I first saw this area, I had written it off.
but Jake told us to go through.
It was a big leap of faith.
We pushed our way through a ton of weeds and as we neared the corner, saw a chainlink fence that had been opened up.
We crawled through the gate easily, and climbed up onto a slight embankment.
About 3 feet away, there was another small fence that opened out onto the sidewalk.
It's hard to see, but this is the small opening that led to the sidewalk.
Paul is about to push his way through, onto the street.
As soon as he got out, I pushed my way through.
I snagged my hair on the gate, and ended up being stuck momentarily.
but eventually slide down, onto the sidewalk.
When I emerged, I popped out right in front of a group of runners, who were also making their way to the checkpoint.
I have to say, I bet it looked really cool/creepy, seeing someone appear the way we did: two guys, crawling out from under a hole in a fence, emerging from the darkness.
At the second checkpoint.
I'm not sure who the woman was, but she was obviously a chaser.
She had perched high up, Batman-like, and had on a pretty bad-ass trenchcoat.
She would stand/crouch, and very calmly, very quietly taunt all the runners.
Awesome and unnerving.
When we arrived, we found a very large group of people (75 - 100).
Every runner was given a pen and a scrap of paper.
We were told to write a letter to a friend or loved one who had died, and to add our letter to a nearby wall.
I was pretty surprised by this, and really caught off guard.
I found myself thinking about my Uncle Jackie and my friend Ann, and eventually wrote a short message to Ann.
One of the walls, where our letters were posted.
It was an interesting experience - running and playing, and then suddenly being taken from that mindset into a more contemplative, somber one.
The volunteers did a good job keeping the crowd quiet, partly out of respect for the nearby neighbors and, IMO, partly to keep a sense of reverence about the letters/wall.
In a lot of ways, I found the checkpoint to mirror how we handle and experience death - everyone going about their tasks, incredibly focused on what's in front of them.
only to be caught off guard by death, and having to confront it unexpectedly.
I'm very curious what will be done with the letters, and would love to read through them all.
Around this time, I got a text from Jake saying that he had been caught.
He was near a friend's house, so he decided to exit the game for the night and ducked out.
Paul and I continued towards the next checkpoint, and en route we had gotten chased and separated.
Once again, it turned out to be a false alarm.
but it was getting really hard to tell friend from foe.
Oftentimes, on seeing another group, you'd start to run - then they, on seeing you run, would begin to run.
And then suddenly both groups have freaked one another out, and it takes a while before everyone realizes there were no chasers to begin with.
A girl who got separated from her group joined me briefly.
I forget her name, but we were making our way towards the third checkpoint and decided to stay together.
I think at this time Paul was across the street.
I made the mistake of walking out to a nearby main road, and we encountered a group of chasers who were just clustered together.
I got tagged in short order, being unable to make it around the corner.
Can't remember his name, but this is the guy who got me.
At this point in the game, it was maybe 9PM or so.
As a chaser, I wasn't sure what to really do and just wandered around aimlessly for a bit.
I made it to the nearby \?'
We chatted for a bit (inside a safezone).
He had escaped and was still in the game.
I wandered away as Paul went off to look for the hidden checkpoint.
In a nearby alley, I spotted this small underground parking lot and just really liked the look of it.
Decided to snap a photo.
I eventually found another group of chasers (Emily, Chris and Tyr) and joined them for the remainder of the evening.
We traveled a lot by bus, and made our way towards the fourth and fifth checkpoints.
Paul texted me later that he found the hidden ?
checkpoint, and was given a sweet prize: he was able to skip checkpoint 4.
So he was making his way to checkpoint 3, and then could head straight to checkpoint 5.
Interestingly enough, I was using Paul's updates to keep tabs on where other runners might be.
So I informed the folks I was with, and we adjusted our plans accordingly.
On the bus, Tyr (whose name comes from Norse mythology) and Chris look over the map.
We went all over, and I found myself up near Devon and Western.
I hung out with the three of them for a good while, and we ended up encounter a group of veteran chasers hidden in the neighborhoods, just east of checkpoint 5.
One of the chasers was the woman with the trenchcoat, who I had seen earlier at checkpoint 2.
We crept around for a while, and there seemed to be a ton of chasers prowling about.
After a while, I decided to head off on my own to see if I would fare better just going out solo.
I wandered a bit, and was trying to find my way over to checkpoint 6.
But after a bit, I began getting pretty tired and found myself a little lost, near Touhy and Ridge.
I spotted a cab, and decided to call it a night around 10:30 PM, and headed home.
On my way back to Logan Square, I learned that Paul had made it all the way to checkpoint 5.
He said there were two girls who he kept seeing, and who kept chasing after him at multiple points in the evening.
He had been running a LOT more, and was calling it quits as well.
In order to get to 6, he would have to re-run a gauntlet that he had just gotten through, and said he didn't think he could do it again.
He debated for a while, and eventually also made his way home.
Home again, home again.
With a few scratches as my trophy.
This is so not an exact map of the route I took, but it mostly captures the spots I went to over the course of the game: Google Map.
What an incredibly fun, fun night!
I'm bummed we got so far off course with the first checkpoint, and I am thinking that next year.
I may try to do a more public-based path.
I learned that Jen's friend Eamon used a bit of subterfuge to get through the race.
Halfway through, he donned a change of clothes and put on a reflective vest, as well as a hardhat.
It was a really fun time, and my only regret is that I wished I would have been around people I knew as a chaser.
It would have also been fun to make it to the final checkpoint, but I just ran out of steam.
I am definitely, definitely doing this again next year.
I just wish I didn't have to wait a whole year for the next one!
I am sore everywhere.
Last night, I met up with the Journey staff at 5:30 outside Eckhart Park in Chicago.
There were 7 of us \seeder chasers\' and at least 15 other volunteers to run checkpoints and organize the start/finish lines.'
Runners (participants) began to arrive around 6pm and the event was slated to begin at 7.
I headed off to my designated hunting ground around then with Ted and Joe (two other seeder chasers that I had met earlier this week).
We were stationed between checkpoint 1 and 2 to start with and most of the runners would have to go right by us if they wanted to make it to the end.
As I arrived at my hiding spot, I got a text confirming that over 400 people (likely 425) had shown up to participate in our event.
Highlights:
chased someone across a huge, deserted parking lot and then into traffic
laughed with a cop (who was sitting in an unmarked car that had pulled up next to us) about the runners looking for whole foods.
When he asked if I was looking for that second checkpoint, I told him \NO!'
 I jumped out and four athletic young men bolted away like there was a zombie uprising behind me


The after-party was at a bar a block from my house and there were improv comedians, musicians, and awards.
I ended up talking with at least a dozen different people at the finish and got home around 1:30am.
This year, Journey was a HUGE success.
I had a lot of fun, took a few runners down, and explored more of the city.
Volunteered for JTEON Chicago again this year.
Last year I was a chaser, this year I was slated to work the starting point and then move on to whichever checkpoint needed extra bodies.
I met up with my friend who was running, got a bulgogi huarache (wtf right?
well, it was good!
) and then headed to the park.
Introduced myself and was assigned to crowd control.
Later someone referred to this activity as \bouncing\'
Well, I guess that's what you call it, but for whatever reason it makes me a tad uncomfortable.
I get visions of goons with clipboards menacing people with mag lights, I don't know.
So whatever, I worked the crowd, which really amounted to keeping everybody moving and telling everyone that any of the 4 tables available were fine.
Yeah, that was me.
\Any table
The idea was to get everyone signed in without a big pile-up forming on the gazebo platform, and it went real well.
I gotta admit, looking at this line I started to wonder if we'd start anywhere near on time:

Runners were moving through at a good clip, but every time I looked up the line was the same length!
As soon as my mind started to drift (which it does often) one of the tables on the far side of the gazebo would wave at me like \Hey guy
But really it only took about 30-45 minutes to process around 750 people.
This is with 4 \desks\'
And next thing you know, there wasn't a line anymore but instead a bigass crowd of folks waiting for the whistle:
I'm not lost, I'm exploring
So instead of waiting for the start, I figured it would be good to head on over to my assigned checkpoint at Foster Beach.
In hindsight I could have easily caught a bus down Foster, or a cab, or any number of simple things.
What I did, however, is wait around for a bus down Montrose with the intention of catching a connecting bus North or taking the El.
And what happened, I'm afraid, was neither.
I waited for a while, forgetting that I could text CTA and get a time the bus was due.
Yeh, we don't have that back home, y'all.
We just hitch a ride on the next passing tractor or stray goat.
Finally the bus comes along, and that's great until it turns north on Clark and I realize I don't know where the hell it's going from there, so I get off.
And walk, and walk some more.
I thought about taking a train, or something, but then realize I've gotten far enough from the nearest line that backtracking doesn't make sense.
So I keep walking, and realize everything I'm passing is an outreach program or halfway house or.
Something along those lines.
But I never felt in any danger, nobody bothered me (probably because I was swinging a maglight around and looking menacing.
)

I did make it to checkpoint 2B, well after most of the runners, in highly useless fashion.
I stuck around for a minute and marveled at the grotesque hilarity of Les Enfants Terribles.
Beyond disturbing but so entertaining.
I can't even begin to explain what they do, just go here and see for yourself, but don't say you weren't warned:
Les Enfants
From there I caught a cab to the finish with another volunteer named Eli, who had been there a while (sorry!
) and was freezing.
We got a couple of warm drinks and had a very interesting conversation about servo motors.
That's not sarcasm by the way, she was working on some pretty cool projects with leftover electronics which i encouraged her to post up here somewhere.
After she left I went out front to give people their finish times for sign-in and direct them to the desk inside.
But the only people interested were the survivors, the tagged just gave me looks like \Why are you telling me this useless shit?'
I would've liked to see the awards handed out but we had another party to get to and a ride, so we took off.
All in all a great time, something I am proud to have been involved in.
Reading the accounts from runners here and on other, lesser websites, it's pretty cool seeing what an impression the whole experience made on people.
I look forward to the next one.
I'd like to chase again, I think, or collaborate on one of the checkpoints.
I don't have any pictures, or video, or comics, or dirt left over to prove that I completed Journey on May 2nd, but I did write a satirical article for The Daily Blank, a (new) online-based newspaper, and it was just published today.
Hopefully, it functions well as a proof!
I wanted to poke fun at how crazy we seemed to onlookers who had no chance to get the full story.

and the text:
Participants of Journey to the End of the Night, an urban street game organized by a local division of the online task-force SF0, could be seen on Saturday, May 2nd, racing to and fro.
Journey, which occurs every spring, holds the intention of upsetting urban space in the form of childlike games such as tag, footraces, and secret agent dress-up.
The more than two hundred players began the race from Jackson and Columbus Avenues promptly at seven p.
With â??Chasersâ? sometimes sporting a complete tennis outfit (including racket) or gorilla suit following closely on bicycles, the scores of runners appeared to know what they were doing as they dived behind park benches, skirted up trees, and shouted, â??ALERT!
â? while jaywalking.
Passersby enjoying Chicagoâ??s seventeenth attempt at spring weather stopped in mid-jog and began asking questions.
â??I was just scared,â? said an overly athletic South Loop resident.
â??When I asked what was going on, a screaming guy told me that the city was under arrest and that the bikers had turned against us.
I looked around and saw an elderly couple on a tandem.
Were they the face of my newfound enemy?
I wasnâ??t too sure.
â?
Witnesses at a small gas station in the Southeast neighborhood of Bridgeport were forced to wait in an inconveniently extended line while a handful of players gathered vitamin water and poured it on each otherâ??s faces.
â??Weâ??ve got to make it,â? one allegedly began panting, near tears.
â??If I donâ??t reach checkpoint two before my ex, I might as well have let him in my bedroom with a chainsaw.
Has anyone seen my manifest?
I lost my manifest with all the stamps!
â?
When questioned about the whereabouts of these mysterious checkpoints, a mustachioed player in a bowler hat materialized from the shadows and began his own interrogation.
â??You, petty villain!
Do you know the exact location of the undisclosed checkpoint between three and four?
Are you in contact with a disguised informant from the sister-game being played in Washington D.
Did you meet with Flash Vespa?
â? Consumers of the gas station fled and were not present for comment.
While the street game held a reasonable ambition â?? to implant a sense of play while protesting urban space â?? it seemed to uninformed spectators more like a scramble away from an enemy combatant.
Witnesses voiced concern about an outbreak of invisible swine flu, as several of the players could be seen writhing on the ground in apparent torment and misery while covering their mouths with multi-colored bandanas.
When a group of six players was questioned outside the orange line Halsted stop, they offered conflicting rationales that spread from political dissent to â??anything better than another night with olâ?? Pabstâ?? to silence â??for fear of spies.
â?? The game concluded at the Co-Prosperity Sphere on Morgan St.
between 31st and 33rd in conjunction with a similarly unexplained art event, VersionFest.
Still donâ??t know what this article is about?

going into this, shazbot and i didnt know much about muni.
that soon changed
i had my normal load of crap in my pockets (see my wallet contents task results)
i also had a (1.
5l) bottle of water in hand and shazbot was carrying 2 more bottles in his backpack (one was half full) .
by the end i drank 2 of them
sadly we didint catch a few parts of the rules and instructions:
we didnt see the addresses of the checkpoints until on the way to #2
we didnt get the part that chasers had a time limit while runners did not until going to the bonfire

for the sprint, i was 3rd before people started to slow down (and so did i to let shazbot catch up)
as everyone ran through the ground level of ec4, we ran to the upstairs of ec4
we asked a security guard how to get to the first checkpoint, we then went downstairs and got on the 1 california bus
within the next 2 or 3 stops, about half of the other competitors got the bus
we were going up the hill (beside the fairmont) and there was a suv in the way, everyone ran out of the bus at this point and got their signatures
shazbot and i then walked more than we should have and then caught a bus going to market
we then transfered to a bus that didnt go all the way to checkpoint #2 so we walked a few blocks and finally got there
after this we walked many blocks and got on a bus that took us to geary
then we walked 4 or so blocks in waiting for the bus
we then got off a stop before the one at checkpoint #3 .
with a purple guy .
both the purple guy and i were unsure of the rules about mini safe zones (apperently it was only the shelter and i thought til the road after the stop, and the zombie didnt know better .
wooo)
so shazbot ran ahead and was on the other side of the street, as the zombie was looking up the muni dmz rule i mouthed run to shazbot
shazbot took off and the zombie soon followed
i cautiously walked toward the checkpoint and i came upon both the zombie and shazbot standing in the street, the zombie then said he would let me go if i would tell him were the others went .
i forget how but he then left shazbot and i alone
shazbot said he would walk with me to get folk that came up to us.
we went to the checkpoint and as i walked out i realized he was tagged in the street of a dmz
after meeting the zombie again and a phone call, shazbot became blue once again
we got to a bus stop that would get us to either checkpoint #4 or #5 (we were unsure if we would go out of order)  and  someone pointed out the 10:45 time limit in the instructions
we then gave it up for the night and headed for the bonfire
after some time at the bonfire we got on an n judah muni train and went home
i slept 12 hours that night and spent 10 hours resting when i got up.
I've been meaning to post this for a while!
This was the 4th Journey To The End Of The Night that we've organized, and I think it was the best one yet.
Beyond my usual organizer activities I made an energy drink for the event this time round.
The drink is called 'A Tale of Two Cities Energy Drink: It Was the Best of Times, It Was the Worst of Times.
'
The drink contained:
crushed caffeine pills
crushed taurine pills
diet pills (ingredients included caffeine, guarana, St.
The Wombat Bloodhound Kookaburras convened with the rest of the intrepid journeyers a bit after 7.
I kept having flashbacks of the last time I was in that patch of grass, when we screened  â??A Trip Down Market Streetâ? last September.
Since we had already gotten tickets for the Nurse with Wound show at the Great American Music Hall, we knew that we probably wouldnâ??t be able to make it to all five checkpoints, especially with MUNI running on a weekend schedule.
So we decided to go as far as we could in the short time that we had.
For the first leg, we set out across the upper level of Embarcadero Center.
Ronald kept lookout up ahead for chasers, and we made a point to walk and not run (why look like a target?
We sneakily exited EC at the very end and proceeded up Clay Street.
It was a steep hill, but we didnâ??t run into any trouble.
One last push up Mason and we were safe at the Fairmont.
But it was already after eight oâ??clock.
We definitely werenâ??t going to make it to all five stops.
After we got our signatures and had a critical rest stop, we headed out again.
Before leaving Mason street, we saw the silly chasers in the tiny yellow go-cart.
One was playing a recorder.
We agreed that this was a good sign.
Avoiding the cart, we continued up California towards the 27 lineâ?¦ the original plan was to take the 27 to Powell Street station, and then take Muni up Market.
But the bus wasnâ??t coming, and we were thirsty, so we detoured to Cala to get some beer.
Then it was on to Van Ness to hopefully catch a 47 or 49.
Once on Van Ness, we saw a gaggle of other players waiting at the bus stop.
So rather than standing around, we cut up to Franklin.
Ronald liberated a balloon from a car dealership along the way, so now we had a mascot.
The peaceful evening air must have made us a bit too comfortable, for several blocks later we encountered a chaser on a bike.
Ronald yelled out â??hey, heY,  hEY, HEY!
â? and he, Sierra, Jen, and Marcus all took off running.
I figured I was done for, stood my ground and said â??Hiâ? to the chaser.
He gave me the nod and rode right past me, after Ronald.
Good strategy, I guess.
I ducked into a bus stop, nervously peeking around the corner to see the rest of my team scattering across the street.
I could see Ronaldâ??s balloon bobbing in the fading light.
Sierra and Marcus disappeared.
Jen got caught.
Ronald met up with me and we hoofed it back to Van Ness.
Soon Sierra called, and the four of us met up again at the bus stop.
What about Jen?
We decided to go on without her.
It was almost nine, and weâ??d soon be heading back to go to the show.
We could meet her later.
Besides, sheâ??d been caught: she was dead to us now.
After some sneaky bus-stop avoidance maneuvers and a trek through the Octavia median strip, we made it to Itâ??s Tops and got our second signature.
But then it was time to head on to our next eveningâ??s appointment, so we called Sweetie Jim and waited for him to pick us up and schlep us to the show.
We found Jen there, and gave her the last beer as a consolation prize.
The rest of the night was a fog of situationist sound collageâ?¦ but I have to admit that I kept nervously looking for purple ribbons in the crowd.
thepuppies made it with all 6 signatures and two stamps.
Our aggressive training program with Rocky in the mountains of the USSR paid off.
I was an out of control, Scootcarting, world war one pilot looking chaser for the journey, June 17th.
We chased down and wreaked havoc in the lives of many a poor journeying soul.
Unfortunately, due to a last minute scheduling change with my theater company, our big awards show got moved up and I was unable to attend the Journey.
I was nominated for Best Cross-Dressing.
So, busy as I was, I thought I'd turn things over to an old friend who's been laying low for a while.
He'll do the tasking, I'll do the writing.
This task will be handled by Queen Isabella's favorite privateer: Capitan Barbapoca!
proof:1, size:70
We manned checkpoint #6 in the Presidio
proof:31, size:70
We setup not too long before dusk.
We had the classic spraypaint SF0 sign front-lit by a flashlight and supported by a stick with a banana peel.
We also had a boombox and an owl on a post (from an old task that will never see the praxis.
proof:33, size:70

We had treats for those who came by our checkpoint: whiskey, Fernet Branca (some wierd liqueur), bananas, apple slices, bread and water.
We ran out of everything by about midnight.

The first people to arrive were Robert and Edward

We were a couple hundred feet from what was apparently officer housing (Presidio used to be a military base) and we invited the locals who passed by to drink with us.

Many players and chasers came by throughout the night.
I always like to meet fellow players.
That was nice.
Unfortunately i had some of the whiskey with many of them and I'm sure I made an ass out of myself.
I know I introduced myself twice to Ariock, kight of chaos.
I'm sure I got on Aaron's nerves more than once with my awful piano skills.
proof:13, size:70
I got the majority of the people who came by take a picture with the owl.
For what its worth, the picture collection (except the first) is in order from last to first.
After showing friends around the city, we gathered at Steurt Plaza for an epic night.
We tied our yellow arm bands on and drew paths on the map for all the group members to follow.
As we took off from the starting line we immediately lost 2 members of our 6 person group.
We ran and ran and got so close to the first checkpoint when we encountered our first chaser!
He threatened us and when we did not move he ran after us.
Quick, time to find an alternate route!
The four of us ran until we lost him and then we took out our map and found a new way to get there.
Finally we reached the checkpoint and got our signatures.
Off to the second.
We were halfway there and had entered a safe zone but there were chasers scattered about.
We tried to make a mad dash across the intersection and one of our group members got caught!
(We had actually lost another person by this point) my last partner and I tried to save ourselves and ran about another 50 feet when we were ambushed by another handful of chasers and got caught.
It was somewhat disappointing to have been caught.
No more goal, nothing to live for.
An eternity of dragging people down.
But we caught a few people, then one of our group members became ill and it was time to return to the real world.
This was my first Journey, I ended up going with people from the Chicago Parkour group (we made up a 9 person wolf pack), I had never been downtown anywhere besides the riverfront and UIC so the experiance really opened my eyes (I had never even rode CTA before), the game started late due to over 500 people needing to sign in but when it really started we dashed off, sending scouts ahead to plan from the rooftops, sheperding those who needed help, and only encountering 1 chaser until zone 2.
Once we got stamped and set off, we were ambushed while going down the shore, when we met up at zone 3, one of us had been caught.
The troop stood together until half-way to zone 4 when we were abushed by an organized group, we split into 2 teams, one team got caught, mine didn't until 10 min.
later when a wild card jumped out of no-where and got me.
Only 1 teammate made it through the entire thing.
The next day I took all the ribbons and wrote a phrase from moments I got them.
For the Red chaser \Surprise Attack\' for the wild-card who got me
It all started with a group of four friends.
We arrived at Dupont promptly at 7pm.
Others were already highlighting their escape routes while we were tying our blue ribbons on our skinny arms.
We noticed the Marines talking and unanimously decided they were going to win.
After standing around, listening to the rules and sizing up our competition it was time to start and when the commands were said, we ran off in the direction of the White House via New Hampshire.
Unfortunately, most of my group is out of shape and only my friend Katie and I (the only girls) were able to keep a steady running pace (hooray for track).
Despite our slow men members, we made it to the first checkpoint in good time.
The wait was not too bad, even though some people were complaining.
Upon receiving our stamps the five of us were off towards the Taft memorial.
Naturally, after only a few minutes of jogging, the guys began to slack and we decided that taking the metro would be faster so we rerouted ourselves towards Federal Triangle.
As we were going down the escalator we talk of how lucky we were to have avoided all the chaser so far, we heard that some were crazier than the previous year at the last checkpoint.
The train to South Capital had arrived as we did so we made a dash for it, but Katie's metro card was not working!
All the guys were through and they were standing one foot on the platform and the other on the train waiting for us.
I made a split decision and told them to go on and that Katie and I would meet them later.
Obediently they got on the train and Katie and I decided to run.
About ten minutes later Katie and I arrived at the memorial and none of the boys were in sight.
We borrowed a phone (both of ours were stashed in a friend's pocket) and left the guys voice mails, saying that we had gone on without them.
Now Katie and I were a team of two.
Since we had been doing quite a bit of running, we selected to go to the 3rd stop by metro.
We jogged up to Union Station, making faces at a few cameras on the way.
From Union Station we went to Rhode Island, got off there and ran up Florida to reach the house.
Yet again we had made it to a check point with no chasers.
Quickly we sketched drawings of our futures and came up with our next route.
Unlike the previous stops, we encountered slow walking chasers the second we left the safe zone.
We ran back to the check point to reevaluate our plan.
We decided to wing it and just go with whichever street seemed quiet.
We ran on R until 6th street where decided to go up towards Howard.
At a bus stop on 6th we saw a crowd of people who we knew were just waiting to chase someone.
Suddenly one of them spotted us and started sprinting towards us.
Katie and I made a mad dash back to R, running like our life depended on it.
Just a street over, we saw a cop car and ran up to the officer making a traffic stop.
Out of breath we ran up to the cop saying \Officer!'
Kid
First and foremost, I want to extend my deepest apologies for the lack of pictures.
I had made a logic conscious choice that a camera would only hinder my ability to run.
I orginally wasn't going to post a completion to this as I don't find my particular situation quite outstanding, but I read everyone elses stories and it made me smile in rememberance of this wonderful evening, especially when I knew I was mentioned in a strangers story.
I also have to apologize because I am long winded when telling stories such as these.
Prologue
     My 'Journey' to Chicago started weeks before the event.
Myrna and I had made tenative plans to attend, and the excitment began to build.
As the day grew nearer, we would exhibit random outbursts of giddiness and excitement when we discussed the upcoming event.
Orginally, Myrna and I had planned to run together, but she ended up hurting her ankle days before the scheduled day.
She was still anxious to make it to the event, so I decided to still run in the event, and she was going to be working a check point.
I had intended on studying a map of downtown Chicago and it's public transit before leaving, but I never quite found the time.
The day finally arrived, with me ill-prepared and running behind schedule.
Myrna and I left over two hours after we had orginally planned to, but still with plenty of time to make the event.
Journey
     When I arrived at the event I had a friend of ours and her current love-interest with me.
We enrolled as a team of three and listened to the rules from Dax as we attempted to formulate our running route.
We had quite the issue deciding on how much/often to use the trains, as we figured that chasers would be expecting that and protecting the stations near the checkpoints.
When the race started, everyone bolted off in differing directions, my excitement level rose, and I headed off.
We spent a little bit of time being cautious, using alleyways and small paths between buildings to get around.
After some time of not seeing a single chaser, and only a few other blue ribboned companions, we walked briskly down a main street and up Elston to the first checkpoint.
We were met with delicious vegan style cupcakes and two friendly faces which have been pictured in others' praxis of this tasks.
I gladly ate a cupcake and quickly regretted it as my mouth became more dry and thirsty.
Looking south down Elston we noticed our first chaser and decided to head towards a train station instead of venturing southbound down Elston.
Our journey to the station was uneventful, and I was starting to wonder if there was more then one chaser in the game.
We made it to checkpoint two without much commotion and were greeted by a tea party and Myrna.
After some words of encouragement we departed for checkpoint three.
Oh, the journey to checkpoint three.
My memory fails to recall the route we took.
I do remember this though:  All was fine, and then there was red.
I'm not sure if it was one or three of them, but I saw red, and it was close.
My concern instantly became getting away.
I wasn't concerned with getting lost, I wasn't concerned with losing my teammates, I just wanted to stop seeing red.
I quickly vaulted over a parking garage gate and into the structure.
I looked behind me and didn't notice anyone pursueing me, but I wasn't about to calm down yet.
I made my way out of the other side of the structure, looked around a few times and didn't notice any red, so I calmly started crossing the street and pulling out my map to get my bearings.
Before I was even able to get my hand out of my pocket, I noticed a caped villian atop of a bike grinning at me.
I was mildly frustrated at this.
Chasers everywhere it seems!
I decided my parking structure getaway worked well last time, so I entered yet another one.
I ran into it a ways and hid behind a large red sign while intently listening for the turning sound of bicycle gears and tires.
After a minute or two I decided I was safe, slipped from my hiding space, and out the back of the structure.
I ventured to checkpoint three without much more incident.
I called my teammates and told them I'd meet them at checkpoint three.
I went inside, got my manifest signed and waited out front.
I was getting anxious though, very very anxious.
After all that excitement, sitting still was driving me crazy.
My teammates strolled up from the south, with a chaser not too far behind them.
Being in a safe zone, they were in no danger.
I directed them inside to get their manifests signed and stayed outside to watch the chaser.
At some point I lost track of him and decided to investigate a little bit.
Upon reaching the edge of the safe zone my anxiety got the best of me and I decided to venture to the fourth checkpoint alone.
I started to casually stroll towards it while examing my map to determine my route.
I was periodically looking around me for signs of danger when I spied the same chaser from checkpoint three stalking me at a mild pace.
I assumed he didn't want his running to alert me to his presence so I wouldn't sprint away.
After seeing him though I broke into an immediate and full on sprint.
I was running with abandon, I had no idea where I was heading, and I didn't even care.
After two full city blocks I looked over my shoulder and he was still behind me!
I was quite amazed, I had expected him to give up by then, as he wasn't gaining any ground on me, and I was at a full sprint.
I was figuring he would realize that he wasn't going to catch up and stop wasting the energy.
Oh, was I wrong.
The determination he possessed was amazing and appalling at the same time.
I continued running, knowing I couldn't slow down.
Suddenly an oppurtunity presented itself to me.
I was running towards a busy intersection and a cab was getting ready to make a left through it.
I quickly ran up alongside the cab and ran through the intersection inches away from it, while mimicing it's pattern to avoid getting hit by any other cars.
I'm not sure the cabby even noticed me, or if he did, he showed no signs of it because he didn't slow or seem startled in the least.
I hit the other side of the street and continued my sprint while looking back to note what happened to my pursuer.
I was correct in assuming he wouldn't be able to cross the street with me.
I was so very wrong to assume he wouldn't still be chasing me.
My arms and legs are pumping with everything I've got and he is on the opposite side of the street doing the exact same.
I start to near a fancy hotel with a red carpet laid out in front of it and those nice little velvet ropes.
The door attendant is peering at me like I'm fleeing from the police as I begin to close on him, but I take no notice, nor is he a concern of mine at the time.
I end up leaping through the crowd in front of the building and over the carpet while I receive inquisitive looks from every direction.
I'm not sure if the blue ribbon attached to my arm offered some sort of explanation for my actions, of if it just posed them another question.
The attention gathered from them was quickly forgotten as I had to decide on my next plan of action.
My pursuer and I have been at full sprint for almost five city blocks and this didn't seem to have an end in sight.
I decide that I should take my next right so it forces him to cross the street to keep chasing me.
I was hoping that traffic would prevent him from making it across and aid my getaway.
I darted around the corner and around one more before ducking into a parking garage and hiding behind a wall.
I had to catch my breath, I could feel my lungs crying for more oxygen to supply my muscles with.
I really didn't think he had noticed me slip into the parking garage, but I was wrong once again.
He came around the corner and look directly over at me, and I had nowhere to go.
My only reaction was to mutter a curse in frustration and hand over my ribbon.
I had to offer my respect though, if I was going to get caught, at least it was in a manner such as this, by someone with complete determination.
My Life as a Chaser
     I spent the first fourty minutes of my time as a chaser lost on the Chicago public transit system.
The red line south was being worked on so I was routed north to transfer to a southbound detour at Fullerton.
I was with my former pursuer and we discussed the game and Sf0.
He was new to Chicago, heard about the game and decided to come to try to meet new people.
I explained to him the game, it's orgins, and Sf0 and encouraged him to sign up.
Then we got down to the business at hand, plans to prevent any of those vile and smelly runners from reaching the finish line.
We decided to canvas checkpoint four quickly, but then move to checkpoints five and six as four was a poor strategic position for us poor chasers.
We split up on either side of checkpoint four and were going to meet around the block shortly.
I ran into my old teammates at four and gave them a snide smile as I knew I could start to chase them as they left.
At four I experience some of the joys of being a chaser with the way that runners interacted with you.
I was an object of fear.
A simple smile at a blue ribboned player and a suggestion such as 'I wouldn't head south if I were you' generated a wave of reactions.
I rested at four a moment, looked around for my cohert in red and left when I couldn't locate him.
I took the train down to checkpoint five and noticed some blue ribbons in the car ahead of me.
I sat calmly and pressed my red arm band against the wall in an attempt to hide it.
I paid little attention to the car ahead of me as I figured they weren't going anywhere until the same stop I was.
When my stop arrived I waited a moment before exiting so they wouldn't notice me and stay in the safety of the safe zone.
Upon exiting the train I slowly walked down the stairs on my way out to make sure they were outside of the train station before I caught up to them.
Then I saw them, four of them, standing right outside the doors to the train station.
I opened the door and took two steps into the middle of them.
I joined the conversation and waited for them to notice my red ribbon.
Though they weren't in the train station, something felt wrong about just tagging them in such a manner.
No chase, no excitement, no nothing.
Just a simple tap on the shoulders.
They noticed me and didn't immediately run into the station, but made such profound statements as 'Hey guys, that guys a chaser.
'  I suppose they assumed that if I hadn't tagged them yet I wouldn't, and they were fairly correct.
After a moment they did decide to retreat to the safety of the train station, and I stood outside and made a quick phone call.
As I'm doing this I notice something very very odd.
Two girls are walking towards me, one of them a blue ribbon, and the other a red ribbon.
They continue towards me until the blue ribboned girl finally notices me when she is less then fifteen feet away.
Her reaction was quite priceless.
I'm sure her mind was thinking, 'Calmly turn around and walk the other direction.
'  Her body though, it didn't quite read the instructions that way.
She stopped so suddenly and spun around with a look of horror on her face.
Her friend stepped between us and told me she'd fight me for her.
I chuckled, and decided since I gave the other four a chance, I'd let this one go for the time also.
She didn't quite trust me so she kept her distance and crept into the train station.
I decided that now was a good time to grab a drink and use the restroom so I headed to the nearby Walgreens.
Walgreens referred me to the Jewel across the street as they didn't have a public restroom.
As I'm casually strolling in Jewel, not expecting any sort of amusement, I notice three blue ribboned players at a checkout lane.
Not just any three, these three were of the group I left alone right outside of the train station!
I couldn't give them a reprieve twice, so I calmly walked up behind them.
One of them noticed me coming in so I was expecting them to drop their items and run out the doors, or at least have some sort of reaction, but they continued checking out as if they didn't notice me.
Perhaps the girl decided not to say anything and hope I didn't notice them, or perhaps they didn't care, I'm not sure.
All I knew is that I was going to tag them this time, and I wanted to make sure none of them got away.
I also wanted to make sure that the entire Jewel mart witnessed this incident, and to do that I couldn't just walk up and tap them all on the shoulders.
So I decided to add some theatrics by leaping into their group, tagging the three of them and spinning in the air.
I screamed a shout of truimph upon landing on the ground and basked in the glory of their downtrodden faces.
I offered my apologies for ending their run so close to the finish, which I did feel sorry about on some level, but the duty of my red ribboned arm was much more important.
It was at this moment that I noticed the fourth in their group.
She was in the back, attempting to keep checking out her items as if nothing had happened when I caught a glimpse of her ribbon as she moved something across the scanner.
I remarked about how I hadn't seen her and tagged her calmly.
I wished them luck as chasers and headed out towards the final checkpoint.
I saw no more blue ribbons on my way there, but I ran into the red caped biking chaser.
I walked a few blocks with her while talking before heading to the end point.
Epilogue
     I truly, truly enjoyed this event.
I had a wonderful time both as runner and chaser.
I truly enjoyed meeting all the wonderful people I did at the event, after party, and during the rest of my stay in Chicago.
I extend my deepest thanks to Dax and the other organizers/assistants whom made this possible and pulled it off in such splendid fashion.
Because of Journey Chicago, I can now navigate my way around downtown Chicago mildly, and if I'm ever running from a mugger, I'll know exactly where the safe zones are.
To those of you whom I didn't speak to much, or didn't hang out with during my visit there, I hope to catch you another time.
To those of you whom read this entire thing, I want to thank you for your patience.
With that, I am retiring to bed to rest my legs that are still hurting from this event.

On this January afternoon, oak zero was cleaning house.
Working our way down the staircase to our dusty basement, someone noticed a box marked 'KSFO RADIO' and 'glasnost.

Through the Noise of A Crackling Radio
One: Night's Arrival
Darkness spreads across the city.
Paranoia lashes at our brains.
Around every turn our hearts race, as we squint desperately at red armbands and dark, hidden eyes.
A day in the city was always long, but the night would last even longer on Market Street.
Fog whistled in on catfeet as the pursuit began.
This is the story of our endless journey to ocean's edge.
We gathered after dinner, huddled in Justin Herman, sipping drinks to warm our bones.
Three men in dark glasses, faces hidden by tall lapels, brought us our missive.
In a sentence, the rules for our survival.
We were to be marked in blue, and our pursuers, red - if we wanted to be alive tomorrow, we needed to follow instructions exactly.
'You ain't got a chance in a place like this.
'

Yoshi, infamous agent of indemnity, was on already our tail and had blood on his mind.
Ready with his henchmen, he would surface again and again.
He showed his face so our fear could have a name, and then disappeared as fast as he'd come.
We looked after him, but his trail was hidden by rising steam from an open street vent, gone into the urban jungle.
The first goal was the staircase, and the white tower.
Who would meet us there?
How would we proceed?
The whistle blew.
Our paths split and crossed again as the sun rushed to disappear ahead of us.
Ghostly beggars and sharp suits costumes on the people of the street.
As fleeing runners, we learned not to trust anyone, lest they turn towards us in pursuit.
We were fueled by Jack Daniel's whisky and raw fear, and only this potent combination allowed us to evade the red enemies.
Yoshi saw we had beaten him once, and was hungry for our bands.
But we had safely reached the tower.
There our first contacts quenched our thirst for water, but not for answers.
Looking out over the city, Chinatown was ahead.
We knew that North Beach was so full of agents we had less chance than a GI in Normandy.
Leaping over a short stone wall, we exited west and carefully made our way downhill, hearts pounding over the din of the pulsing city.
Two: Miteux Alone 
Outside of the first safe zone, fear took control as the agents' devious tactics split our tightly knit group of four.
I was lost from the other three.
Not knowing that my three compatriots had found the fire-haired, image-macroed stranger, I ventured off, confident that I'd see them on the flip side.
The facts of the matter hit me like a magnum slug at close range.
No one at my side, I bolted down the street, cursing my luck.
Seeing the back end of a rickety truck, I grabbed hold of it and jumped on.
It was transporting the dead cardboard of a hundred purchased boxes - deader than I'd be if this truck didn't get going.
It wasn't moving fast, but the agent on my tail gave up.
He left me in the center of a pack of henchmen I couldn't see.
Racing, zigzagging through the neighborhood, I hadn't the faintest idea where to turn.
At Via Ferlinghetti I was spotted again.
Reds at either end of the street left me no option.
It was defeat, or the alleyway.
I chose uncertainty, and ran down the short backstreet, hurriedly seeking a stairway, a fence, a fire escape.
Behind a dumpster I pressed my body against the wall.
and discovered a door handle that moved.
Quietly letting myself through to the other side, I locked it behind me as my eyes adjusted to the inside light.
It was a bar, and a fancy afterhours party was on.
I looked the part as I'd worn my best necktie.
Nobody asked any questions of someone breathing hard, walking fast with wide open eyes.
At the bar I got a soda to look inconspicuous, but the door I'd come in by was drawing attention.
I had to give them the slip.
out the side door.
Referring to my guidemap, I saw that the only way was downhill - south - into Chinatown.
Walking out into the street, I found myself at the busiest intersection in North Beach.
Green Street, Columbus, and Stockton.
Immediately two agents appeared, and I was off sprinting.
Up the hill was a cable car.
my ticket to safety?
I reached it after two blocks and jumped on, but was promptly kicked off.
The illegality of my actions had no bearing on my decisions.
Escape was the only idea considered.
Leaving the car, I ran again.
One block, on me still?
Two blocks, there they are.
I ran until my lungs burned and gravity stopped pulling me down.
At the bottom of the hill, I moved forward into streets twice, three times.
Every street in which I entered, approaching the safe zone, there was a risk that I was too smart to take.
But if I couldn't make it to the second point, had my compatriots already received the information?
I betted on trusting them, in a place where no one could be trusted.
Not knowing if they had been captured or if they could evade the reds, I gave up on China town and moved back up the hill.
When I had gotten within a few blocks of the third safe zone, Yoshi appeared again with his cohorts.
'Is that him?
It's him!
'  

I saw signs for Wetmore, Washington pass by.
My eyes saw red as my legs stopped functioning.
With only my own dwindling energy to keep ahead in the pursuit, the only path to escape was straight over a fence, falling into the bushes.
Laying silently, hoping that I wasn't seen, for what seemed like hours, but what must have been moments, I only heard the sound of my heart beat.
Vaporous breath escaped upwards, through the leaves.
At the worst moment possible, I was caged.
The steel door to the garage was bolted down shut.
No way out.
or was there?
Once again my salvation was by chance.
I pinned myself against the wall in the corner by the steel gate.
A cc-security system eyed me as I hid my face.
After the padding of feet raced up the hill, I ran across the driveway to the fence.
Leaping, I only just grabbed the upper end of the fence.
My weak and tired body refused to be pulled up and over, but it meant my life.
I heard the shouts of the reds out on the street.
Any second they would return and see my helpless body hanging on the fence.
Finally a rush of energy enabled me to top the fence, and roll over.
I hit tree branches on the short fall down.
tearing at my arm and face, they drew blood.
Better the tree than the clutches of Yoshi.
An apartment dweller leaned out and yelled, 'Git outta my yard!
You bastard, the cops are already on their way!
'  Now it was even more dangerous.
I hoped against hope that the safe zone would give me some respite.
I walked hurriedly through Nob Hill up to California Street.
Faithfully, like sweet charity, a second cable car creaked up the hill.
Boarding for the second time, I collapsed at the feet of the brakeman.
He'd seen stranger things, I could tell by his glance.
I was only three blocks from safety and nobody would stop me now.
Trademark flying dismount.
I'd seen it before and executed another only to come face-to-face with none other than Boss Kizu Blair.
He looked up from his map, surprised.
But he had bigger fish to fry.
Zooming off on his Schwinn he left too quickly to see my group come out of the market, overjoyed.
We had made it all to point three.
Now that the boss had seen us, it didn't seem like there was any way we could get away safe.
We discussed our options, and fled south as fast as we could.
Three: Evasive Maneuvers
Underfoot the concrete passes, pressing up hard on swollen feet.
We know the end is nowhere in sight.
But failure is not an option.
TO BE CONTINUED.
From FoxyChachi: I didn't know what to expect, going into the task.
I packed with a Sharpie, water, paper, a blanket for the beach, some granola bars and a head lamp.
Our team was able to remain intact through the whole Journey.
I think because we were small, and not known by a lot of other players.
We really only had one run in with chasers, which happened outside of checkpoint 2.
We ended up with a large group of players and the chasers were circling us like sharks.
We waited for the next bus, and the chasers got tired of waiting, so they eventiually wandered off.
It took us a long time to get through all the checkpoints.
We stayed pretty close to the bus lines and burned a lot of time waiting at bus stops.
We ran into other players on some buses, but we all disbursed at the checkpoint stops.
At the end we met up with Rubin and another guy (sorry dude, can't remember your name) at the end and completed checkpoint 5 together and got to the beach together.
We finally found the bonfire as it was dispursing due to heckling from The Fuzz.
Fatigue took over and we cabbed it back home shortly afterwards.
On a personal note, I had never been to so many parts of the city at night before.
It was interesting to see how the city changed at night.
My favorite check point ended up being the one in the park.
I had been the most nervous about it, since I knew it would be the darkest, and I wasn't sure of safety there.
But the headlamp worked well, and we were safe.
In fact, the only other people we met were other players.
I also really liked how they set up the checkpoint there - the glowing cone was a neat effect.
I, along with Burn Unit and Lauren, planned Journey to the End of the Night Minneapolis.
But I will admit that the details behind it are a little unclear.
It started started way back in October, 2009.
Back in 2008 Burn Unit, Teucer, OliverX, Star5, Ink Tea, and I had all come together put together a game.
We had always wanted too do it again and in October, Burn Unit got in touch with me with the intention of putting together a simultaneous game with the game in San Fransisco on Halloween.
This didnâ??t come together.
The weather didnâ??t support it and we didnâ??t get the planning together.
So we cancelled the event and stowed the planning weâ??d done away until spring.
Sometime later, after a winter of thinking about it and not doing much of anything, we started began planning again.
Iâ??m not sure when.
Over time we decided on a route, recruited or enlisted various staff for the checkpoints, obtained the required materials, and did all of the tasks required to do.
I donâ??t really remember when.
Planning for Journey to the End of the Night was done concurrently with me finishing my last semester of college, so I was also doing a lot of essay writing and reading and not getting a lot of sleep.
Actually considering the amount of things that the planners had going on outside the game, itâ??s surprising that it even happened.
But happened it did.
Which brings us to the day of the event.
I showed up at Prospect Park much too early, around 6:00.
For about half an hour I waited around until Shea Wolfe showed up and then we waited fifteen minutes more until Burn Unit showed up.
Then we all waited for the ribbons and manifests to show up, as players slowly started to trickle in.
Ribbons and manifests didnâ??t show up until 7:30, which made both Burn Unit and I very anxious.
On the plus side we actually picked up a checkpoint three during this period â?? we had previously planned to have it unmanned but someone came by and said that they were interested in being a checkpoint agent.
We sent him off with a location and we were set.
Once the ribbons and manifests finally arrived, they were distributed and I explained the rules (with a megaphone that someone was foolish enough to give me) and then released the players.
Once everyone was well sent off, I hopped in a car with Burn Unit and Felix (who was going the sixth checkpoint) and was dropped of at my checkpoint.
For my checkpoint, I was The Runner.
I dressed in green and blue ribbons all over my legs and arms, plus some through the button holes of my jacket, more around my bag, and my old Chicago runner ribbon tied around my head.
I also added a few of the extra life ribbons from the first Journey, for extra ribbon action.
I also had a clipboard (with some more ribbons on it) and a big pile of manifests from previous Journeys.
When I saw a runner, Iâ??d run straight towards them (despite being in a safe zone, half of the time people would start running away) and Iâ??d start yelling â??I NEED YOU TO SIGN MY MANIFEST!
â? Once they signed my manifest, I would sign theirs and run away.
The manifests had been swiped from various planner Praxises from previous Journeys to start with and then once I had collected all of those that I could find, I went to bother other people about sending me them.
Dax kindly sent me maps for Chicago 2008 and Oakland, CG0 sent me a secret copy of their 2010 map, Star5 gave me a copy of the 2009 Minneapolis map, and Fin gave me copies of Viennaâ??s maps.
The acquisition of the manifests bring me great joy.
Iâ??ve been managing a growing collection of these manifest maps, which I hang above my bed so I may stare up at them at night.
A lot of people found my checkpoint confusing.
Sometimes it took them a moment for it to sink in that I was the checkpoint agent.
One player told me afterwards that heâ??d thought I was a crazy hobo, who wanted him to sign my manifesto.
Other people I thought I was a player.
When there was any doubt, Iâ??d say â??Well, if thereâ??s someone around whoâ??s dressed or is acting oddly, theyâ??re probably the checkpoint agent.
â? That usually clued them in.
People were also confused on why they had to sign my manifest, but mostly I just yelled at them until they did it, grabbed their manifest and sign it, and then ran away.
After all, I was the runner.
I am personally very happy that my checkpoint was so confusing.
The theory that I had in my mind for the checkpoint was that I was a runner running an alternate version of Journey, one where I stayed still and the course moved through me.
For my version, every player a checkpoint.
One guy got it immediately.
When I shoved the map for Journey Berlin into his hands, he took one look and said â??Oh.
Youâ??re playing an entirely different game.
â? That was it exactly.
When a map was full, or when there was a lull between groups of runners, Iâ??d take that manifest of a map and pin it to a board I had (which was basically just a box I got out of a recycling bin and collapsed).
I started off with it covered in manifests that Iâ??d accidentally printed single sided, and I added more and more maps as time went on.
Iâ??m not sure if any of the runners actually noticed my board, but I gave me something to put the maps on and a way to display them at the end of the route.
I was simultaneously handling communications between the checkpoints for this Journey.
I got checkpoint agents to call me when first runner showed up and then Iâ??d pass that information on too the next checkpoint and the chasers.
I was also talking to Burn Unit a lot, trying to manage the game as it developed.
The two useful things things that I actually ended up doing were that we felt that the first group wasnâ??t having enough trouble of it and was moving too fast, so I tried to get Shea Wolfe to intervene and jump them, and when it became clear that Burn Unit wasnâ??t going to be able to make it to the end before the runners, so I tried to find someone to send there instead.
In the end I ended up sending one of the staff chasers there, although they didnâ??t get there before the first group.
I didnâ??t record when people where showing up at the time, but I can reconstruct events based on my phone records.
At 7:55 the first people hit the first checkpoint, at 8:19 they reach the second one.
Iâ??m not sure when they hit the third checkpoint (maybe at 8:25) but at 8:50 they hit the fourth checkpoint.
At 9:06 they hit my checkpoint and from there I lost them.
This of course the first group.
The last group came through the third checkpoint around 10:20 and I was done at my checkpoint by around 10:45.
Other news from my phone log is that at 8:43 there were 20 people making it through checkpoint 2.
At 9:00 I called Rachel to ask if she could cover the end, since it was clear the Burn Unit couldnâ??t make it in time, and at 9:25 I called her to say that she should head over then.
At 9:42 Burn Unit texted me to inform me that heâ??d found a bike chaser, which was cool.
Thereâ??s also a steady stream of texts and calls to and from Shea Wolfe about where things were, what was going, and me telling him to catch more people.
My checkpoint was right next to the after party, so at eleven when my checkpoint closed I just took my board full of manifests and hauled it over to there.
Then I basically didnâ??t do anything for the rest of the night until I went home and slept.
Look back on Journey, there are things that went well and things that couldâ??ve gone better.
I wish weâ??d been able to figure out the routes earlier, so we could have given people more time to come up with checkpoints.
I feel bad about thrusting it on people at the last minute.
We also could have used more staff chasers.
Two is too few.
But these lessons have been filed away and will be used to improve future games.
Journey has a compelling enough core that even if you screw some things up, people still have a great time.
But I feel that if you did it right, the game could go from being fun to being sublime, possibly even life changing.
Thatâ??s a goal to shoot for anyway.
Whatâ??s next for MNÃ??
Couldnâ??t say.
Perhaps Journey Saint Paul.
Burn Unit has been talking about running AandU.
Who can say?
Keep your ear to the ground.
UPDATE: Now with pictures!
What an unexpected way to spend my weekend.
This task entered my life sometime between Tuesday and Wednesday and made itself real on Saturday when Calyx and Myrna Minx arrived at my apartment and Steve Rules was already there.
It was sunny and overcast at the same time as we made our way into Chicago.
We parked our car next to Wicker Park after seeing a quite interesting collection of scavengers gathered around the fountain.
Sign up, get your ribbon, read the rules.
Dax speaks on his device and we're out.
Steve Richey, Calyx  and I formed a team as Myrna Minx had departed to work the second stop.
I had no intentions of finishing or collecting any prize but after being separated between 2 and 3.
with Calyx and I sprinting into a parking garage, my ending up hiding under a crane.
and Steve Richey outrunning the chaser.
we all ended up separated and upon reunion at the Billy Goat I was very determined.
Calyx ended up splitting from the team as he felt the need to do and we didn't reunite with him until stop 4.
Befitting the galactic rules of karma, Calyx had become a chaser.
HE informed us that he had a plan and this caused uneasiness but I couldn't say it lasted.
On our way to stop 5 we encountered many chasers, most of which we successfully avoided.
Technique became interesting with reds teaming up with blues and many people trying to tag in safe zones.
My lungs were in stitches and my legs were on fire.
Our only method of safety was going at least 2-4 blocks out of the way in any direction to avoid chasers between checkpoints.
The miles we walked seemed at the time to be endless and I felt as if my legs would crack into two pieces each and splinter each other.
Stumbling through Grant Park my breath was heavy and Steve Rules and I had eyes wide open and hesitant steps.
The sidewalk of Lakeshore Drive felt like heaven and i collapsed there fully stretched, head on the pavement.
looking at the sky and not caring about the way I must've looked.
This was a trophy in itself, this rest.
this stop.
this safety point.
We kept going.
although someone tried to tag us right off lakeshore.
We were in the safezone and weren't to be misinformed.
We're not company for misery or the like.
At the end.
a group, a joyous group.
the lights dimly lit around the aquarium, reflections upon the water that looked like fire.
and a very happy, very unique collection of people, adventurous and triumphant people laughing and smiling and relaxing on blankets and grass.
We got medals.
and although we were much too exhausted to stay for the after party.
the time was insanely enjoyable.
One cab back to the el and then in the car to home.
How about you?
I started out in a group of three, though early on we accumulated a few more runners.
We lost a lot of time early on by running through bonus checkpoints, keeping us at the back of the crowd and largely out of harm's way.
Once we got to the third (official) checkpoint and recieved our yellow ribbons (and thus, didn't have to take any more side trips) we quickly made our way back into the thick of things.
Another group arrived at Checkpoint 3 just after we did, and we cleared out while they were sorting their business, heading northwest.
Almost immediately, the herd started stampeding from behind me, someone shouting about a chaser.
We all broke off into a desperate run, funneled through the unforgiving straightaway by buildings on either side of the street.
At my first opportunity, I broke left around some weird decorative structure, and only just in time.
The chaser, one of the guys with spray-painted orange hair, flashed past me (still following the runners who went straight) and I panicked again and started running, following my friend MPuzzle's lead up a.
weird planter, display, thingy across 2nd Ave.
hiding in the dark and shadows.
As I bolted up the bottom levels of the tiered.
thing, I saw the Chaser making his way around, apparently having been momentarily distracted by something, before heading back to the northwest.
Making my way low and quietly to the top of the.
thing, I verified that he was nowhere in sight, and came back down.
MPuzzle, Gabrielle and myself were all that was left of our original seven.
We picked up another stray, but she quickly evaporated into the night before we so much as got her name.
We made our way to Nicollet, hoping to find a bus relatively close.
There was one a few blocks down, very slowly making it's way towards us.
Not knowing what happened to the Chaser(s?
) from checkpoint three, we all tried watching every direction at once, willing the bus to come faster.
As we were walking towards the bus stop, just as I was about to suggest calling Dawn, who was seperated from us, she appeared from around a kiosk.
I slowed my pace as I checked her arm - blue ribbon still, but the yellow was gone.
We traded stories until finally the bus arrived and we were safe.
Boarding the bus, I scanned the other passengers, looking for arm bands and finding none.
We settled in for the ride, but before long, we spotted the orange-headed Chaser who broke us up after checkpoint 3 walking along the bus route as it approached the next bus stop.
We muttered quietly, each of us trying, through the force of our will, to prevent him from boarding the bus, but to no avail.
I was sitting in a forward facing seat immediately behind the sideways facing seat the Chaser settled into.
Just as we did, he scanned the occupants of the bus as each of us tried to look casual and cover our armbands, somehow.
A splash of yellow poked out around my bag, betraying me, but I tried to keep cool, consciously ignoring him as he looked me over.
Eventually I broke into an embarrassed grin and explained, for our Chaser's benefit, 'That was my 'Poker Face.
''
He grinned and our party at once relaxed, for not having to try and play coy anymore, and tensed up, knowing that the chase was on.
Explanations were offered that we weren't worth the trouble, that he should find better targets, and the like.
All the while, the bus rode through the night.
We made small talk, he asked if we were having a good time and we quickly assured him we were.
By this time, some of the other passengers started looking at the lot of us, knowing that there was something going on.
Our host explained, briefly, the game, explaining with a grin, 'and these guys are in trouble once they get off the bus.
'
'Oh, we're not getting off the bus,' I assured him.
'We're going to find out where the bus ends.
'
As we spoke, the stop we had intended to get off at came and went and soon the Chaser gave up on us, choosing to get off somewhere in the general area of where he wanted to be rather than try and wait us out.
Some three blocks after the stop we wanted, we finally debarked the bus, jumped a fence, and ran for the shadows.
Orange was fast, after all, and we couldn't be sure that he didn't get off the bus just to get us to move so he could come after us.
As it happened, we made our way to Loring Park, and into view of checkpoint four, without further interruption.
Checkpoint four itself, however, had more chasers drifting about.
The checkpoint was out in the open and there was no safe approach so in the end we just broke and ran for it.
I stayed close, but far enough back that the Chasers would hopefully have already picked (other) targets by the time I got there, and it worked out.
I'm pretty sure we all made it, actually, and manifests were signed.
Once again, we waited for a gap in Chaser attentiveness, and broke away.
We made our way through a large, open courtyard between some apartment buildings.
Here, opportunities for ambush were plentiful and we were on high alert as we made our way, as hurriedly as we could, through them.
When we finally came back to Nicollet Ave.
we saw a bus pulling up to a stop at the corner.
Being that the bus meant safety as well as rapid transportation (and another chance to sit) we ran for it, arriving at the stop just as the bus pulled up.
Hurriedly we filed in and sat down, plotting out what we would do for the next stop.
According to our maps, it appeared that we would only have to make it across the street to be in the next safe zone.
My council was to overshoot by one block and come back around, but in the end we decided that we could scope out the checkpoint from the safety of the bus and make our decision then.
As we approached, the checkpoint appeared clear so we all filed out of the bus and broke into a run to make it across the street.
Just before I hit the sidewalk, I saw Jane, one of the Chasers, bolt out on an intercept course along the sidewalk.
Torqueing my knee and almost taking out one of my fellow Runners in the process, I made an immediate change of directions and ran in the street on the other side of some parked cars, then running straight into the door of the coffee shop.
Inside there was a man at a table with a hideously fake blue beard.
Not pausing for anything, I sat down across from him, sweaty and breathless, and offered my manifest.
Outside, Jane and Liz were circling, waiting for us to break out of the safe zone.
Jane was right on our corner, and Liz was guarding the bus stop across the street.
Talk was made of finding a back door.
MPuzzle had asked but had been told there wasn't one.
Dawn went to find one herself, soon returning and pulling MPuzzle inside to go to the bathroom.
Jane was eyeing us up, knowing that there was something going on.
I tried to come up with a way that I could get the other members of my team to quietly join us, but it just wouldn't work.
As casually as I could, I made my way inside, looking for the back door that had to be there.
At about the time I laid eyes on it, MPuzzle was calling to clue me in.
Outside, we briefly discussed our options and if there was a way to bring our fellow runners to safety with us, but it just wasn't feasible, not without putting ourselves in too much risk, so we bolted through the night, ditching down the alley and skirting around some residences.
After we decided that we had a good head start, even if we weren't exactly safe, I called the coffee shop (through 411) and asked the annoyed clerk if he could discreetly let Gabrielle know about the back door.
'Fine.
But this is the last thing I'm doing for you guys!
' he snipped.
'I really appreciate it,' I offered, glad that I was able to get my one request in.
Hoping that the rest of the team would have a shot, we continued on our journey, heading north on 1st, a block off the main route.
Being that we were close to another bonus checkpoint, we decided to hit it, just for giggles.
So far, there hadn't been any chaser activity at any of the bonus sites, so we were pretty confident.
What we found, instead, was that there didn't appear to be a bonus checkpoint again.
This time there wasn't even any sign of it, whereas the missing third bonus at least had a note.
Eventually, MPuzzle found the stamp while rooting through the garbage for a sammitch and again, we headed off to the north.
In relatively short order, we were back downtown and closing in on danger once again.
Suddenly, we were within a block of the final checkpoint (I didn't realize just how close we were!
) and we started moving quickly, staying in the shadows, looking for dark alleys.
We moved swiftly between two buildings and jumped a fence into a parking lot.
Dawn, on point, called out 'Chaser!
' MPuzzle darted back over the fence and I jumped into the dark confines of the shoulder-width gap between the building to my right and what was likely the enclosure for the building's dumpster, leaping over a rotting heap that may, once, have been a homeless person.
The other side of said heap was no less disgusting, but far less deep, so I crept along the shadows, ensuring that there was a way out (albeit even narrower than the channel I was in) and trying to get a look around.
I saw nothing.
Not Dawn, not a lingering Chaser, I had no idea if there was someone immediately on the other side of the wall, lurking outside the opening, or if everyone had moved on.
I waited, listening, until I saw MPuzzle poke his head around on the far side of the building.
Making a break for it, I scaled the fence back over to the safe(er) side and regrouped.
A phone call to Dawn revealed that she had been caught by a chaser.
Not that we'd had any grand strategy to begin with, but now we needed to re-work it, assuming that Dawn would be after us, having known exactly where we were and more generally where we were planning to be.
Very carefully, we crept back and around, opting to take an even longer route to the final checkpoint.
Eventually we made our way down Grant towards the Convention Center.
As we crossed the street, I spied to our left a woman who seemed to be taking a little too much interest in us.
I steered us a little to the right and she adjusted course to match us, quickening her pace a little.
'Let's go,' I said and MPuzzle and I were running, the Chaser hot on our heels, I broke left as MPuzzle ran on and now the chaser was after me.
I tried dodging and weaving through and over hedges and decorative rock piles and had started making some room between us.
All the while, I kept reminding myself that I wanted this more, all I had to do was keep moving and make the Chaser realize that it wasn't worth the effort.
I was winning when I tried to take a short-cut into what appeared to be a gap that might let me back out on the street.
Instead it turned out to be a solid wall and I was forced to loop back out to the right, affording the chaser a shortcut to gain some ground and the confidence to push harder.
I was tiring, now, and wouldn't be able to run too much more.
Searching for any escape, I found a fence separating the grass I was on from a parking lot.
Rather than chain-link, it was an iron fence, two horizontal bars with maybe eighteen inches underneath them.
Beyond that was a drop of two feet or so into an asphalt parking lot - too much of a drop to go over the fence.
The chaser was right behind me and I wasn't even sure I had enough time for this, but I ducked down and slid to the fence, pulling myself under the lowest bar and sliding and rolling down the concrete embankment.
I staggered to my feet and glanced over my shoulder to see her standing at the top of the fence.
'I'm gonna have to give you that one,' she offered, staying put.
'Oh, god, thank you!
' I called back, waving exhaustedly.
I never stopped moving, but I was less frantic now, trying to make some distance, but unable to really run.
I was safe from the Chaser, though, and I breathed a heavy sigh of relief, hoping to quickly rejoin MPuzzle.
And that's when the other Chaser came around the corner.
'Oh, fuck you,' I laughed.
Quickly I glanced around, maybe even took a few steps, but the area I was in was fenced all around, the only possible quick escape would be directly into the arms of the Chaser who had already almost run me down.
Whatever I did, though, it was enough for the new Chaser to break into a run.
I threw up my arms, stopped and called my hit.
When she tagged me I fell to my knees on the asphalt in relief.
The Chaser who ran me joined our little party in the parking lot and, panting and out of breath, I started working my yellow ribbon off.
I got it most of the way off before I thought to ask, 'How long pant after I give you this pant do you guys come after me pant again?
'
'Thirty seconds,' the new Chaser offered.
'pant You don't get this yet pant.
'
She laughed, giving me the chance to catch my breath, explaining she had done the same thing earlier in the night.
I drew this out as long as I felt I could without pushing the boundaries of sportsmanship, handed over my ribbon and we all wished each other luck in the remainder of the night.
As quickly as I could, I ran into a parking garage across the street and almost panicked when I thought I'd just run myself into a dead end.
Finding the pedestrian exit, I met MPuzzle on my way across the street and told him there were two Chasers and we had to keep moving.
Coming out of another narrow alley between two buildings, we fell in with a crowd of people on Nicollet moving, apparently, from one bar to another and rode that merry band until they broke just before our final destination.
With the fountain area of the final checkpoint less than a block away, we broke into a run.
This, of course, attracted some attention, and this time the Chaser went after MPuzzle while I skirted the edge of the fountain, above the level of the finish line, but below street level.
As I went, I was searching about for the actual finish line and, once I found it, I ran up roughly parallel before dropping down several tiers of decorative nonsense, along the way jumping onto the bench of a couple who were making out in the shadows, calling over my shoulder as I leapt onto and then off of their bench, 'Sorry!
'
At the bottom, I made my way around and casually threw myself on my ass at the finish line as MPuzzle finished his bit of chase at the bottom of the fountain and rejoined me.
Completed manifests were presented, 'flowers of courage' were offered, and brief stories were exchanged.
I texted our victory to some friends and we went to the after party in a nearby hotel to find out how the rest of our party made out and share tales of glory and tragedy.
My legs are still sore.
(Goddamn flat feet and shin splints!
)
It was one of the most fun nights I've had, like, ever.
Notbatman, Dawn, and I got to the starting point at the east side of the Stone Arch Bridge for our first MN Zero event.
There we met up with fellow players, Runners and Chasers.
I was surprised but happy to see two familiar faces in the ranks of Chasers Liz and Jane.
We set about putting on the blue ribbons while BurnUnit went over the rules.
There was a fun little moment when a local drunk stumbled into the fray to loudly question what the hell this was all about, and accuse us of doing the devils work.
Here's a Google map I made to reference the Checkpoints, Bonus sites, and the path we took.
The game began.
The three of us had decided to hit the Bonus on Nicollet Island first instead of going right for the 1st checkpoint.
I started jogging out casually to the north until I heard someone yell 'Chaser!
I looked over my shoulder to see a guy with a red ribbon chasing down someone about 15 feet from me, and coming my way.
I didn't realize there were active Chasers at the start point.
I hit the gas and sprinted about a block before ducking into a trainyard with Notbat and Dawn.
We made our way through Saint Anthony Main/Riverplace, past an Octoberfest celebration (sad face), and across the bridge to Nicollet Island.
Paranoia had set in.
Notbat was convinced that Liz and Jane would jump out at us at any second.
Our heads were on swivels from that point until the end of the night.
On Nicollet Island we found the Bonus, stamped our maps, and headed to the 1st Checkpoint.
Near Nicollet Island we met and teamed up with a few other players Gabrielle, David(?
), a guy who had won the LA Journey game, and a few others.
We casually yet cautiously made our way down University Ave to the U of M campus.
We probably should have waited for a bus, but apparently I can't read the schedules correctly, so we walked.
We made it to the 1st Checkpoint without seeing a single Chaser.
The person manning the Checkpoint signed our manifests and we headed out to the second Bonus site the amphitheater-like bowl near the U of M Field House.
We made it there without incident, and Notbat collected maps and ran down to stamp them while others stood lookout in a perimeter.
We headed for the 2nd Checkpoint, cutting through campus using some tunnels Dawn knew, bringing us to Washington Ave.
We decided catching the bus across the bridge was the best way to go.
The top deck of the bridge was a safe zone for Runners, but we figured there would be a gauntlet of Chasers on the far side.
This didn't deter the guy from the LA Journey, and he and another Runner in our group struck out on his own on foot (I later found out they were chased, but made it safely off the bridge).
We eventually got on the bus and rode across the river to Cedar Ave.
After a short walk with no Chasers, we had our manifest signed at the 2nd checkpoint, at The Hard Times Cafe.
Here we met up with another group of Runners, bringing us to around 7 or 8 people.
We all wanted to get to another Bonus point to get the yellow ribbon, but we weren't sure whether to go for the one in Gold Medal Park to the north, or for the other one to the west.
I thought Gold Medal Park was the best option, but someone pointed out we could swing wide south and come in under the western Bonus.
A long path that walked us though some interesting neighborhoods, but was almost certain to be free of Chasers.
So south we went, and went, and went.
Eventually we arrived at the Bonus point outside of the Band Box Diner.
The only problem was that the stamp had been taken.
In its place was a piece of paper saying to call Journey Central.
I called, only to get Voicemail.
The rest of the group walked across the street to the Elliot Park Market to ask a stranger to sign their maps as proof we had been there.
I walked in to look for a bathroom, saw none, saw a very confused looking guy behind the register trying to understand why a group of people wanted him to sign a piece of paper, and left.
I called BurnUnit again, and this time got through.
He gave me a verification number to write down in place of the stamp.
I shared it with my teammates once they were out of the store, and we were good to go.
We headed out the 3rd Checkpoint, just north of the Hennepin County Govt Center.
The trip there was again uneventful, though we were still as paranoid as ever.
Once at the Checkpoint, we got our manifests signed and showed the proof we had visited three Bonus points.
Now we had a shiny yellow ribbon to add to our blue ones.
The 4th Checkpoint was in Loring Park, so we decided to head to Nicollet Mall and take the bus south.
We had just started walking west when a group of Runners ran past us.
Being twitchy, I started running too.
I pulled up along side one of them and asked if they spotted a Chaser or if there were just trying to make good time.
He told me they were just trying to make good time.
Like a chump, I believed him and slowed down.
I was telling someone that there was no Chaser when I heard someone behind us yell 'CHASER!
Son of a bitch.
I sprinted to the end of the block and angled left across the street, hooking to the right into a plaza.
There was a tall tiered planter/sitting area on the corner of the plaza, but other that that it was very open.
The only exits were either where I'd run in, or through to the other side, which would've likely run me right into the Chaser.
I scampered up the planter/seating area to hide behind some bushes and have a look from higher up.
If I'd been spotted up there I would have been stuck and screwed.
I peeked over the edge and there was nobody around.
I looked back down into the plaza and saw Notbatman and Gabrielle coming my way cautiously.
Soon after that, we were rejoined by Dawn and one other.
Dawn had gotten caught, but luckily she was able to sacrifice her yellow ribbon and get away.
We all got together and continued heading to Nicollet Mall to catch a bus.
We made it to Nicollet and got on the bus without further trouble.
But about half way to the stop near Loring we spotted the red-haired chaser on the Mall.
We tried to make the bus drive past him through sheer force of will, but no luck.
The bus stopped and he got on.
The five of us tried our best to hide our ribbons while the Chaser sat directly in front of Notbatman, facing sideways and surveying the crowd.
Notbatman kept it together for a while, but he eventually cracked a smile and told him 'That was my poker face'.
He looked us over, said something to the effect that a Chaser would be really happy to meet us when we got off.
Notbat said 'We're not getting off.
We're going to stay on this bus to the end'.
Luckily it didn't come to that.
The Chaser made a phone call and got off near the stop we were hoping to take.
We rode a couple stops past, got off, and backtracked our way to Loring.
We approached the Checkpoint quietly from the south, walking into the park a bit to possibly use the trees for cover.
When we spotted the Checkpoint itself we all broke into a jog which quickly became a full on sprint when some Catchers made themselves apparent.
The Catchers were between us and the 4th Checkpoint but somehow we all managed to evade them and get to the safe area.
We then headed back east on a greenway/path/plaza type thing, getting back to Nicollet Mall just in time to catch another bus south to the 5th Checkpoint.
We weren't sure how to approach the Checkpoint, but at the last minute we decided to just get off the bus right in front of it and make a mad dash across the street for safety.
We made it, but by the skin of our teeth.
Once our manifests were signed, we started assessing the situation.
The Checkpoint, Spyhouse coffee, had two exits, both of which were watched.
Standing guard were our friends Jane and Liz.
There were also a couple other Chasers in the area, but I didn't know where they hid.
I asked the guy behind the counter if there was a back door, he said no.
So I stood on the patio, figuring out how far it is to the alley and whether I could get there and disappear in time, when Dawn came up and asked if I had to use the bathroom.
She knew I had stopped to water someones bushes not too long ago, so I figured she was just trying to get my attention without tipping off the Chasers.
I followed her back inside where she lead me to the back door of the coffee shop.
The one they supposedly didn't have.
We snuck out and I made a call to let Notbatman know about it.
The three of us crept down the alley and between a couple houses to a dark side street.
We felt bad about ditching our two teammates, but Jane already seemed suspicious.
So Notbat called Spyhouse and asked the guy there to please tell Gabrielle about the back door.
'Alright.
' He said, 'But this is the last time I'm doing you guys a favor.
' Turned out Gabrielle and company had made a dash for the bus when it pulled up across the street.
Jane and Liz(?
) got to them before they got on and yanked their yellow ribbons.
Notbatman, Dawn and I continued north on 1st ave, intending to hop over to Nicollet to catch another bus to the 6th and final Checkpoint, Peavey Plaza.
While waiting near a bus stop I thought it over.
If I were a Chaser, I'd be riding that bus back and forth near Peavey, just waiting for Runners to fall into my lap.
So we decided to walk the rest of the way up 1st ave.
We stopped to get a fourth Bonus at Stevens Square Park on the way, just for shits and giggles, and because it was practically on our way.
After searching for 10 minutes for a missing sign and stamp, I finally found them in a trash can.
It wasn't worth any points or anything, but it got us some bragging rights.
We stayed on 1st until just past the Convention Center, where it turns into Marquette Ave.
That brought us to within a couple blocks of the final Checkpoint, so we decided to try a little more stealth.
Dawn jogged down a side street and found an alley going in the right direction.
We walked down to find that after about 75 feet it turned right for another 50 feet or so and dead ended.
The 50 foot stretch of the dead end was actually a tall fence.
There was a parking lot on the other side that was only open on one end (to Marquette ave).
We hopped the fence and were on our way out of the lot when Dawn yelled 'Chaser!
I leapt back over the fence while Notbat hid in the shadow of the dumpster.
Dawn ran to the back of the lot, looking for an exit that wasn't there.
She slowed down and walked around a bit, trying to act casual I suppose.
I stayed in the alley, watching Ddawn through the reflection of a glass building.
I was expecting her to go to Notbatman for help over the fence, but she walked toward the lot exit.
I saw her stop by a lady for about 5 seconds, then walk north, out of sight.
Notbat hopped back over the fence into the alley and over to me.
I called Dawn and asked 'How you doin'?
' She said that she'd been caught.
I said that in that case, I had to go, and said goodbye.
Notbat and I cautiously retraced our steps back out of the alley.
We made our way south across the street and into a parking ramp under the Marquette Place apartment complex.
We found a door on the other end, came out and hid in the bushes while we tried to think of a plan.
We decided to circle around east and come in from the north.
We hit the sidewalk and headed east, toward the Convention Center.
Notbatman was watching the flank, and as we crossed the street he said he spotted a likely chaser behind us.
I looked over my shoulder to see someone start running in our direction.
In a very casual voice, Notbat said 'Yeah.
Let's go'.
Running at full speed I bolted down the sidewalk, slanting left onto a large open lawn.
I noticed a long hedge in front of me, maybe 2 feet tall.
I decided to jump over it.
Only when I was almost on top of it did I realize it was also 5-6 feet wide.
I managed to clear it without tripping or sliding on landing.
I continued running another couple hundred feet or so then looked back to see if the Chaser was after me and whether she cleared the hedge.
Nobody was there.
I slowed and scanned the area.
To my left I saw what looked like Notbatman sitting or kneeling near a building.
I figured he'd been caught, and kept running.
I ran over to another building and laid down in a small shadow to catch my breath.
After a few seconds I got up and tried to see where Notbat was, but couldn't get perspective.
I ran across the street, away from where I last saw him, and hid in shadowy bushes.
After 15 seconds or so I spotted Notbatman jogging north through a parking ramp across the street and down a bit from me.
I cut across and caught up with him a half block away.
He got caught, but not by the Chaser I had seen.
He had swung through a fence/railing to get away from her, and she let him go because of it.
Only for him to turn and find another Chaser a few feet away.
Luckily he had his yellow ribbon to give, and was still in the game.
We walked another couple blocks to the north, winding through a giant parking ramp and surface parking lot before cutting west toward Nicollet Mall.
We hugged buildings for a block before going through another surface lot and into an alley.
Passing a guy playing bad Van Morrison on a trumpet, we entered onto Nicollet Mall.
Our timing was good, and we quickly blended in with a group of about 12 diners and bar-hoppers with 2 blocks to go to the final Checkpoint.
After one block, we were left with only 4 people who were chatting amongst themselves.
We followed them closely, still trying to blend.
At the intersection just before Checkpoint 6, those four people turned and left us with no more cover.
The ultimate goal was the fountains, on the far side of the block.
I just decided to make a run for it.
Running across the street I picked up speed until hooking suddenly to the left and leaping down the tiers and benches to the fountain beneath.
I passed a lot of people on the way, but I didn't notice any Chasers until I reached the last 10 feet and heard footsteps right behind me.
I hit the floor of the large, dry pool area and kept running, aiming for the corner where all the people were collected.
The Chaser said 'You're safe, you're safe.
' and stopped running.
I made it.
Damn that was fun.
When can we do that again?
For this event, I did a bunch of prep work in addition to being the Morton Salt Girl at Cala Foods.
I helped scout locations, helped procure the tiki torches, and cut out the Sutro Tower luminaries you saw at the end.
While I was at Cala Foods, I bought all the food and drink, which I brought to the Wave Organ (except for that handle of Jameson, courtesy of I think Sean) just before the bulk of the players showed up.
I felt pretty ridiculous walking into Cala Foods in my costume.
I never cease to be surprised, though, at what you can make yourself do if you just have to.
I certainly couldn't back out of this one.
So yeah, I dressed up as the Morton Salt Girl, famous for being on cannisters of salt in just about every American household, in her little yellow dress and purple umbrella.
I walked around Cala for a bit and loaded my cart up with as much salt as seemed necessary (maybe 30 or 40 cannisters, but only half of what was on the shelf!
) for my desired effect, and proceeded to push my burden around the store to collect some delicious snacks for the end party.
While I was doing my shopping, I got some good comments from fellow patrons: \I've never seen anyone buy so much salt before
), from a couple people: \Is salt on sale?'
He was her translator.
At first I thought he asked me what I was doing, and I started to explain it was for a game, but then I realized all he wanted was to know where the salt area was.
I pointed them to the correct aisle and thought, well, I guess I was the right person to ask for that information.
Surprisingly, not a single Cala Foods employee said a word to me, despite the fact that I was standing around for a few hours in different aisles with my umbrella up the whole time.
Perhaps this was because, as someone mentioned to me at the end, I was \acting natural.'
So I wasn't really bored at all.
Anyhoo, a bunch of players came through, mostly jittery and out of breath, and very amused by my outfit!
It was all a quite rewarding experience.
Some of them said witty things like, \When it rains
Someone said something about pasta?
Rob (spotlight skullshines) came through first, basically gasping for air, and took off immediately.
Next, by about 20 minutes (which is why it's CRAZY that he was only behind by 2 at the end) was Edward, who said he'd been looking for me for like 10-15 minutes and thought there was no way he could be looking for a crazy girl with an umbrella in a grocery store.
He was really nice and I hope he joins the site.
A bunch of groups and solo players showed up soon after and I sent them all on to Alan at the Japantown Denny's.
I purchased all the food (I returned all the salt to its proper shelf) and went to my house to change quickly and make genmaicha.
At the Wave Organ, it was great to talk to so many players, many of them new, and hear about the insane shit that was going on in the Presidio (and elsewhere).
A player disguised as a homeless person who avoided a chaser by mumbling crazily?
Lowteck (or Prank Monkey, or Bill Clinton, or whatever) producing an army of drunk chasers and players, stumbling around one of San Francisco's most prized parks?
A player just strolling through the chasers unnoticed because he didn't look suspicious (since he wasn't paying attention to their dangerous presence)?
Someone catching a cable car like 2 or 3 times to escape chasers?
I can't wait to hear about these in more detail.
A super fun night!
The most exciting part of the night was my first chase.
A few minutes after having been tagged (just down the street from the secret checkpoint) our group began chasing a cluster of blues.
I chose my target, a fit, slim girl, and stayed on her.
Chasing her down an alley, around corners, trying to keep my shoulder bag from getting in the way (definitely going with a backpack next time) and slowly gaining on her was so thrilling.
A man protectively pulled his daughter out of the way of this footchase.
When I finally caught her, we chatted and exchanged stories as we wandered slowly back to our respective groups of friends, now all wearing pink armbands.
Around 6:30 i met up with the organizers and chasers.
proof:2 proof:3 
initially i resisted the baguette, but after very little coaxing partook.
i got my (not really any) instructions and (completely useless) map and ski-daddled with most of the other chaser lest we be seen by players.
Why did we move to market street?
we moved again.

i went for food and beer and rolling papers.

i went to a piss-smelling alley and rolled up a \tree\' in front of some stiff looking suit.'
now where the fuck is that hotel?
im used to hills.
mason is a big fucking hill.
smoking does not help.
but i think i might have left an impression on some players early on.
without the intention of tagging anyone i rode through the safe zone to stir them up.
theres one!
double team!
sucks to your asmar!
i rode down to market and chased someone into a subway.
forget about all those stairs.
i let him go.

i dont think i asked if she was ok.
she was nice and seemed to have drugs, so i decided not to tag her.
we tried to get her friends to come over so we could.
but they didn't trust us.
actually they were running away, so i decided to let her go with the idea that we could get high at the beach later.
she introduced herself ( i wish i remembered her name because they never got to the bonfire.
probly killed by cars) which naturally ended in a handshake.
that was actually my only offical tag.
i think i was on geary when i ran into these guys.

i stopped into the pool hall to pee and drink more.
but they didnt have shots and slamming a beer sounded like a really bad (good) idea.
lucky for me a (very high scoring) player was nice enough to give a pull off her flask outside.
I watched them leave and called Rubin Starset (whom i had never met in person) and after convincing him that i was certainly not a chaser planned on \meeting up\' with him and his crew.'
i called some other chasers and told them where the high scoring player was going.
then i got mean and decided to chase them down.
i trapped one on the opposite side of a parked car while the other fled.
i tried to talk her into giving me more booze.
why doesnt anyone trust me?

Don't forget to check out the Flickr tag Journey To The End Of The Night and also the SF0 photo pool.
Rubin: The turn out was so amazing.
Meeting people I've only known about through this site made me go wow.
The count down starts, the buzzer goes off, the Drive shoots us down paths of multiple outcomes.
The group becomes broken, and whole together.
Little yellow cars buzz by filled with mad men, one of which plays a recorder.
We scout and search for purple as we make our way down the hill.
Off the MUNI Metro and into the bike path, only to have Ian Kizu-Blair indubitably shattering our group into many shards.
Running solo down the street, searching for a woman in a trench coat, a drunken delirious transient of The City passes my vision, and from him in a tone paralleling lunacy I was asked a reforgotten question:
Are you playing a game?
Searching in the park, blind without any light, for others may see.
I thanked a man who had a hand in all this night of hysteria.
Tagging along with another group.
Off to a laundry mat, to get a log from someone folding the same sheet over and over again without end.
And so we made it to the fires on the beach.
Faux: 
Mella:  Arriving late with Reed, I was impressed at the mob that had gathered!
Not even enough time to properly affix my blue ribbon, we were off and running.
Separated from the herd from the very beginning by the purple ribbons (they get bikes?
) I was reunited with most of my team at Site 1.
We find our way on foot and public transit to almost Site #2 when we're separated yet again by purple ribbons.
This time not so lucky, about 10feet from a safe zone I literally run straight into a pair of chasers (how was I to know people so cute would still be dangerous?
) while Reed also gets himself tagged.
A moment of disappointment at having to leave the rest of my teammates, and excitement at the oncoming chases - Reed and I joined forces with Tim and Heiress (were those your names?
fun people!
) and Tim's extremely accomodating roommate and her car in hot pursuit of players.
At that moment fantasies began of jumping out of bushes at unsuspecting blue ribbons (proceeded to practice my 'rawr!
\ while striking monster poses).'
The chaser honed in on me and ran me down.
I just can't run that far, and i didn't realize how near i was to a bus shelter.
I donned the purple ribbon and walked up to the fifth checkpoint, where i swear i would have totally caught pirateymonkey from behind if i could have refrained from shouting.
Seeing her jump was almost worth it though.
After that it was the bus to ocean beach and the rest is history.
Red:  This was by far not the first time I had heard of SF0, but was the first time I participated in a task.
I was in the process of moving from Humboldt County down to my current home in San Diego, and was visiting my good friend Rubin.
I had been promising to visit and participate in a task for a while, and this turned out to be the perfect event to spur me into SF0 motion.
The only thing I'm really bummed at was that I didn't have a camera--I bought one the following day.
I don't know that I would have taken that many pictures during however.
Rubin and I met up with Nicolery and she showed us some spectacular metal sculptures around downtown.
We arrived at the meeting point, and hung out meeting people while easting some tasty Subway sandwiches.
I chose not to place my name on the sign-up list as I wasn't part of SF0 then, and was trying not to be tracked meta-physically in any way, shape, or form.
Then, when the race had begun, I gave my map/signature sheet to a registered player who hadn't got one.
However, I kept to the spirit that evening and but for a brief interlude (which shall be explained later) was with Rubin the whole evening.
When the command to go had been given, Rubin, Nicolery and one or two other people from our group began to run off in a direction with no general plan other than get to the first checkpoint.
I did not feel the need to begin running as I am not the most physically fit person, and knew it would be a long evening.
The runners ended up having to turn around, thus proving that they had wasted energy.
Then, as we began our trek up the first hill, Rubin noticed a chaser had locked onto us and our flight began.
Running as far (two, three blocks) and fast (not very) as our underworked legs would take us, we managed to lose the chaser who, like most predatory beings had a fairly short attention span past the initial stalking.
We kept on high alert from then on and made it to the first checkpoint with little further incedent.
From this point, hearing the cry \Blue?'
Everything proceeded smoothly, if slowly, from there, until we were about to come upon the third checkpoint, when a bicycling chaser (who I later discovered to be Ian) came head-on at us, scattering us in all directions like a flock of birds fleeing from a savahnna stalker.
30 mintues of frantically wandering around alone, lost in the Castro (which by all counts should feel like a 2nd home), I was able to regroup with Rubin however, the rest were lost.
Rubin and I then ever so slowly made our way through the following checkpoints, impeded by an ever widening gap in transportation times, and a growing fatigue and sense of desperation.
We finally made our way to the bonfire with our offering of wood and enjoyed the rest of the evening with fire, poi, merriment, conversations, and music.
I have yet to remove from my soul the primal urge to notice all things purple and to give flight at the faintest sound of a recorder flute.
Nor have I quenched the deepset urge to comp(l)ete (tasks) for points.
Thank you all.
I hadn't expected to get lost that early in the day.
It was about half past six and I was trying to find my way to Oakland.
The BART network is pretty intricate on the other side of the bay.
Over here it looks like the Champs-Elysees, over there it resembles Medusa's head.
About two hundred people were already there when I arrived at the amphitheatre, some of them stretching, heel to buttock, reverence for the race part of the game.
I decided to focus on the scavenger hunt part for now and picked up a map.
So, this is what Oakland looks like.
And they have a lake!
Then I put on the green ribbon by myself using one hand and my teeth.
I felt a little bit like a heroin addict.
The flag dropped and I opted for the paranoid route and left the amphitheatre with two dozen other runners, who were also basically running away from the first checkpoint - into a quiet residential neighbourhood.
With hills.
Would possession of a topographic map of Oakland have been considered cheating?
I had to think of the Germans in Douglas Adams's \Last Chance to See\' and smirked on my way up the hill.'
They would have brought one.
From the top of the last hill I crossed the highway and safely made it down into the Amphitheatre of Roses.
No chasers so far, but there were rumours that they did exist.
The scene in the rose garden was - in one word - adorable.
A table, fortune tellers amidst runners amidst roses, the advice to look for unlikely fishermen.
I sat down and watched and after a short while a smile bubbled up from somewhere deep inside me, right onto my face.
On my way out I noticed a co-ed restroom.
Are the Oaklanders out-SF-ing us?
I remained true to my strategy of evasion and ran away from the second checkpoint - right into, deja-vu, a quiet residential neighbourhood.
Oakland seems to have its fair share of them.
Or I was walking in circles.
But no, this time it was one without hills.
But with stairs instead.
With apocalyptically steep stairs.
And with curious people.
A couple of them asked me what the occasion was.
\A game of tag - like what your governor did in \'Running Man\'
The next party of curious people were yelling from a distance at somebody I couldn't see.
Apparently this somebody was hiding behind a car.
They could see him, I couldn't.
In other words: He was hiding from me.
Of course you do.
But I didn't.
Embarrassing?
These quiet residential neighbourhoods just feel too safe.
It was over pretty fast.
He jumped out from behind the car and came running towards me.
I looked into his eyes, I raised my arm so that he could clearly see my green ribbon, I shouted \FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS
Well, at least almost.
In fact, I didn't even move or do anything at all.
I was just too surprised.
And I really should have known better.
\Twin Peaks\' should have taught me that quiet and peaceful places are never what they seem.'
What then helped a little was his claim to have caught ten other runners prior to catching me.
But then again, maybe this is what he told everyone in order to make us feel better.
This was the moment that changed - nothing.
I didn't even really feel like catching any of the friendly runners.
I did, however, feel like seeing the other checkpoints.
All of them.
So I went to the fisherman and his slightly capricious companion first, had a surprisingly tasty peanut butter broccoli sandwich and lemonade after that, saw Theseus fight the Minotaur, and then headed towards the water.
I've always wanted to use the words \serene
And checkpoint five is best described by them.
It was my favourite.
What a wondrous idea!
The light, the water, the lovingly created studies, the doppelgÃ¤nger - I could barely speak a word.
It was just overwhelming.
And so I simply sat down and enjoyed silently watching a group of runners working together to find the differences between the two sides of the scene - and contemplating why I didn't do these things more often.
After a long while I got up again and walked over to the next checkpoint where I learned that it might have been wiser to get a signature at each checkpoint.
But maybe it was just a rumour.
I finally reached the finish line just in time to applaud the first runner to arrive.
I stood there for a while and listened to the follow-up runners who explained their sophisticated strategies.
It was fascinating.
After listening to them I wouldn't have been surprised to hear somebody elaborate on how he had enlisted the assistance of satellite reconnaissance or something as impressive.
Good God!
I felt like such a rookie that night.
But also like a damn happy rookie.
Iâ??m going to start this one off with how much I had been looking forward to this event.
S/I/S had told me about it back at Seeing Beyond Sight.
Well, things donâ??t always work out as you expect them.
So it happens that LeEvil had her first runway first fashion show since re entering modeling scheduled that night.
I had a very tumultuous choice to make.
Either play and experience relationship woes equivalent to the inferno of 1907 or give in, bow out of play, and prevent a fiery apocalypse that would leave my loins dry and lonely for months to come.
I made a compromise.
I would be an opening chaser and leave half way through, race myself over to the east bay and make it just in time to see the lovely lady strut her stuff.
Good plan, right?
To add to the insanity I chose to adopt a puppy about 4 hours before game time.
Enter Monkey, the JTTEOTN Chaser Dog.
Encounter 1:
I took a head start to the park in front of Coit tower (check point one) when I found upon arrival was being guarded by a convertible full of half dressed gay boys from gay.
com (are you?
I skulked about there for a good half hour taking Monkey in and out of the backpack.
I started out a little uncertain.
I felt that I was at a disadvantage since after being in SF for over 2 years I still really donâ??t know the landscape of the city, and I damn sure donâ??t know anything about public transportation.
After not seeing anyone for about 45 mins, I was convinced that I was going to go through my entire short time as a not seeing any action at all.
I decided to take Orion, and Ianâ??s offer to call and get intel.
Pretty much the only solid info I was able to obtain was that I should not be in the park.
Not really what I was looking for, but in the end lead me to my first encounters.
I went to the Coit side of the park and began prowling the street there.
Thatâ??s when the groups started showing up.
I had tied the red band on my wrist under my sweat shirt and was loitering rather suspiciously directly in the path of oncoming players.
They would see me and slow down, but since the band was not readily visible they wouldnâ??t bolt straight away.
I would allow the tension to build and then pull up my sleeve rather dramatically.
Andâ?¦powâ?¦they would be gone.
FREAR IN THIR EYES AND FLIGHTâ?¦oh the power.
I didnâ??t give chase.
They had do go through this pavilion to get to the stairs so I went to the next exit point and hide.
Popping out just as they came up would send them scattering again.
I soon got bored, Not wanting to dawdle too long thereby missing my chance to cut them off again at the next check point.
I took off towards China Town.
I met up with a fellow chaser on the way and we had a rather uneventful trip to checkpoint 2.
Encounter 2:
I continued the skulking strategy once we reached checkpoint 2.
I didnâ??t do much more than delay and scatter players on their way into or out of the safe zone.
The most memorable was seeing a huge group of kids led by Toom waiting for the light to change to walk into the safe zone.
(Who waits for lights in a race?
) I walk up and Toom says, â??Hey, I recognize you!
â? he  smiles and holds out his hand.
I grinned and replied â??Yeah, but do you recognize the badge?
â? there was a short pause of contemplation before a symphony of expletives and foot pounding.
Although I was in arms reach of at least 10 peopleâ?¦.
I let them go.
Encounter 3:
I got lost between checkpoint 2 and 3.
While wondering from street to street trying not to backtrack anywhere where I would have to re-climb a fucking hill, I noticed two youngish girls doing stretches on the corner.
They had a few pretty heavy strikes against them: Doing something to obviously identify as a player in the open, allowing a stranger to just walk up to them, and being past check point twoâ?¦.
sorry ladies someone is getting tagged.
I walked up to them fairly nonchalant smiling.
They smiled back and returned the â??Hiâ? I greeted them with.
Then I said, â??do you guys like my dog?
â? and pointed at Monkey whose head and shoulders was poking out of the back pack.
Their faces melted as they squealed at the cuteness.
One of them reached out to pet her.
Half a moment later the squeals turned into shreaks as they noticed the ribbon around Monkeyâ??s neck.
Her hand retracted like she had been bitten , she was shaking, they were screaming and the both bolted in opposite directions.
I gave them a good 5 second head start.
Since I'm lazy: an opportunist hunter that knows the importance of the conservation of energy I went for the one that bolted directly ahead of me and was running straight up the hill so I didnâ??t have to make the effort to turn around.
I came up behind her fairly quickly.
She to
ok a quick left into the street and was almost taken out of the game by a ford Taurus.
In the next half hour or so I ran up on a couple more people.
But having created my own replacement, I decided not to turn anyone else red.
This is just as true as the fact that I was not fast enough to catch anyone else.
Do you remember my plan?
The making it to the fashion show by 9:15?
Well, when I looked at my watch it was 9:05 and I was on foot nearly to Japan town with my car back at embarcadero square.
Now I was the one turning and bolting for my life.
I franticly caught a cab and raced across the bay at nearly 100mph in a VW Bug just in time to miss leeâ??s stage appearance.
I AM A BAD BOYFRIEND!
But she did get a new dress as a guilt present so everything turned out ok.
Since I found out about sf0 at this event, the proof is minimal, but it is there.
Before I get into it, I want to thank all of my fellow players, especially disembowelled Santa for the doughnuts at the bus stop, and our friend Athena, who protected us and showed us the way the entire night.
For some reason, I have written this next portion half a dozen times thus far, it seem to not want to stay in the record, but persevere we must.
There were about 40 of us from Berkeley running as a group, for about 10 seconds at the start.
Things got pared down so that only Victorian Bad Poet, Thunder Cloud, Athena, Peacock, Ninja, and Garlic remained with me by the time we even left the Embarcadero.
We were worried, very worried.
We took our time and circumnavigated the checkpoints before entering the first two.
At checkpoint two, VBP and TC took their leave to find a (non-existent) dance party.
We started to take the buses then, at that point everything had been on foot, and not the wisest choices of paths either.
Checkpoint 3, was amazing.
It took us almost a hour to get around the chasers in a safe way, and we were all chased by half a dozen of them (thank god for the bus shelter).
We waited for the 27 to take us to the 38 stop, and waited, but were told by a nice couple that there were problems with the line and that the bus hadn't come in about 45 minutes.
We braved the next two blocks with wide, open eyes.
After we solved the prisoner's dilemma, then went on to the Elsewhere Public Works balloon romp, to the game of live action Clue, where Athena made quick friends with Miss Scarlet.
At this point we were bound and determined to get involved for next year, or sooner, and Chatted about the awesome, clever costumes and props at that station.
I also drank Ninja's shot of whisky.
The bus, oh the bus, we were ETERNALLY on the bus.
Not having drank much of anything through the night I was amused and bewildered by the level of drunkenness displayed.
All of the players in my group were too set on winning to think of libations.
That guy just puked all over the sidewalk.
Glad I don't have to come back this way.
At the Red Queen's Tea Party, Peacock bent her tail feathers, and I insisted on doing as much of a Disney Alice \Your Majesty!'
 who chased me 2 blocks up California screaming \'stop that man\'.'
People in the financial, apparently, are a bit too self serving to do anything about such a scenario, but they stared and looked concerned and basically made a path for me as i, frightened as fuck, flew accross oncomming traffic, horns and screaches and sprinting up the entire hill to the hotel.
I was the first there.
The bell hop told me that the best way to my next stop was to get a bus on market.
As a side note, when im exhausted and gasping, i smile uncontrollably,
everyone i interacted with
as a result
was visibly effected by this joyfull mood.
which only made me happier 
to be pursued, to be running, 
down the hill.
and juked out Ian, who was now on a bike, which put me at a slight advantage as far as maneuverability is concerned 
(i just ran in one direction till he was commited to the flow of traffic and then I turned around),
caught a bus on market to the next stop, 
Met the lady in the trenchcoat, hoofed it to the third stop, but not without calling  Maze Designer  (who was at home) to meet me at an intersection near his home with a glass of h20).
The fourth stop slowed me down the most, but i was so charmed to see the glowing cone in that campfire 
ahhh 
this was so close to the art me and 
Tapes On Ten  went to burningman with  in 04 
anyways, i mangledly (word?
) scrambled through the underbrush using my phone as a torch, 
opening and closing
opening and closing
and rushing
cause i'd ran into Ian in the safe zone and he said i was the first to hit every checkpoint so far.
and i was known as the \fucker in the hat\' 
and a wanted man.'
if you cant already tell from my tone
that couldnt have made me happier.
not trusting the bus stops (not knowing they were safe zones)
and shaking with an overdose of adrenaline
i hoofed it (again)
to checkpoint 5
which is where this comic picks up.
(i guess its kinda a nuissance but you have to click on the immage twice to view it at its normal size and read the text parts, sorry, i'll get on that soon)
{the end of my story, 
is i didnt make it there first
i thought i was so far a head and so wanted that it would be better to take a fucked up out of the way route through the park again.
i got there tho.
albeit without the cheers i thought i'd recieve
i was the 5th or 6th, 
not really sure.
}
cheers organizers!
Submitting task now.
editing shortly.
Where to begin.
I heard about Journey to the End of the Night at the Cryptozoo event a couple weekends back.
I immediately knew I was in.
I mean, if you tell me there's a game played out in the real world with hundreds of people, I'm pretty much always in, but I was particularly excited about this one.
See, there's this awesome/terrible show on the Sci Fi channel called Cha$e (http://www.
com/chase/), where 10 runners wander through city streets, trying to survive for an hour against an increasing number of hunters.
Sounds familiar, right?
Well, ever since seeing this show, I'd been thinking about what it would take to run a version of it myself up in Seattle, so you can imagine how happy I was to find that not only had this already been solved, but that I would get to try it out.
Before showing up I asked around at work to see if anyone was interested, but found no takers, so it would just be me and my good friend Beek.
The Journey Itself
We arrived at the amphitheater and collected our ribbons and maps, at which point I decided it would be fun to provide updates on my progress via Twitter.
waiting at the amphitheater with ~100 people.
Wonder how many chasers are out there?
This number swelled to 200+ pretty quickly, and before we knew it, we were off.
We took off at a jog, choosing a slightly out of the way route that led us towards the first big hill (which also happened to be quite a chokepoint, as it was the only reasonable way to proceed).
developing a phobia of orange objects
Even before we saw our first chaser I'd already grown a strong sense of paranoia.
Having read some reports from people who ran in previous Journies, I knew that chasers liked to blend into the environment, so I trusted no one, no matter how inconspicuous they might have seemed.
People with orange clothing seemed somehow more ominous.
Maybe they were wearing that to hide their ribbon?
We encountered our first chaser on the cross street before the hill, with a biker eyeing us from across the street.
We ran the opposite way, not knowing what to expect, and then immediately doubled back when she passed us and declined to turn around.
In hindsight I suppose the chasers were given orders to take it easy in the beginning, but it was scary nonetheless.
The game was on.
using other runners as bait
I quickly realized that I felt safe when there was another group of runners a little ahead bit of me, under the assumption that they would fall into whatever trap was waiting for us.
This worked well until later in the race, when the chasers got more numerous.
On the way up the hill we had a series of incidents:
1.
A woman in an orange jacket, with one hand clasped behind her back, walked directly towards us on the sidewalk.
I reflexively crossed the street, not willing to take the chance that she was hiding an orange ribbon, and then watched guiltily as Beek walked right by her.
\Should have warned him
Luckily, it was a false alarm.
The appearance of a couple chasers at the top of the hill caused panic amongst the nearby runners.
I ran down a path leading up to a small house and crouched in the bushes, until a gruff voice said, \Can I help you?'
I tried to explain that I was being chased, that it was just a game, and that I'd be out of here in a second, hoping that chasers wouldn't hear the exchange and come find me.
Eventually he shrugged, motioned downstairs, and said that his brother might freak out if he saw me.
I didn't know what \freaking out\' would entail
I moved on.
The chasers had moved on as well.
We got to the intersection at the corner of the park that held the first checkpoint and debated our next move.
After deciding to continue forward (the shortest path to the goal), we suddenly saw a chaser in front of us.
Backing up, we saw another to our right, and then another behind us.
We broke into a sprint down the street to our left, with chasers in pursuit.
slid down a massive hill to escape a chaser dressed in steampunk officer gear
Beek yelled, \Here!'
I rushed back and saw a steep dirt hill leading downwards into the park, Beek already halfway down.
I shrugged and followed, almost losing my footing a number of times.
The chaser arrived at the top, took one look, and yelled, \Whatever!'
setting out again after a brief stop at a fortuneteller staffed checkpoint
We made our way to the fortuneteller and received our signatures from the magician, then set off.
Again, there were only a couple reasonable routes, so we soon ran into a chaser who broke into an immediate sprint.
I went around him and continued forward, eventually stopping on a side street with a couple other runners, and called Beek.
He was all the way back at the checkpoint.
\Want to meet up?'
 who recorded our names and images
I considered asking if I could take a sip from the nearby wineglasses, but thought better of it.
Next time I'll have to bring a flask.
Anyway, the nearby area was already swarming with chasers.
We set out a couple times and each time we made a quick retreat to the safety of the checkpoint.
In desperation, we hatched a plan to go around the lake the long way, and headed out on a long journey that would take us past checkpoint four and then back to three.
taking a huuuuge detour around the lake.
too many chasers the other way
Wait, I thought.
Past checkpoint four and then back to three?
That area's going to be swarming with chasers.
But it was too late, we'd gone far enough to be committed, and we stuck to the plan, although I had a sinking feeling that we were in trouble.
Sure enough, when we got to the area between the third and fourth checkpoints, we immediately spied a chaser.
He sprinted after us and we scattered, with him choosing to follow Beek.
By now, I had become enamored with my double back plan, and I shouted to Jessie and Jesper that we should continue forward.
We did, heading along the water and soon enough another chaser showed up, but he was far enough behind that I wasn't worried, so I just kept running.
For some reason I had it in my head that I shouldn't check behind me, that this would slow me down, and I noted that Jessie had just looked back and not reacted at all or increased her speed, so I thought we were safe (although in hindsight I think she was merely resigned to her fate).
About five seconds later I felt a hand on my shoulder.
Two more chasers had (presumably) come down from the stairs above, and just like that, we were done.
I felt a profound sense of disappointment, not just that I had failed so early, but that I hadn't even realized I needed to sprint, that I'd lost without giving it my all.
Beek, having made the smarter choice of continuing backwards to an area we knew was safe, was still alive, and Jessie and Jesper were thinking of hitting up a bar, so the decision was between setting out to chase on my own, or getting a couple drinks.
I was torn.
On the one hand, I really wanted to see the game out, to experience it fully.
Quitting now would feel like giving up.
On the other, I'd been enjoying chatting with my two comrades, and having just moved here three weeks ago, I didn't want to pass up an opportunity to make some new friends.
What made my decision, though, was that despite the orange band around my arm, I still identified with the runners.
I didn't want to inflict that same sinking feeling that I now felt upon other people aspiring to make it to the end.
miscalculated and traveled backwards through the 3 --andgt 4 area.
got beers with some folks instead of chasing.
So that was that.
We found a random bar and talked for a couple hours, until deciding to head back to the final checkpoint around 10:15.
Along the way we ran into a bunch of orange armbands, but no runners, so no chasing was necessary.
I was excited to find that no one had won yet, and there was lots of fun speculation about how many runners were still out there.
I texted Beek to see how he was doing, but didn't get an answer, so I figured he was probably still in it.
Ten minutes later: \Just got caught :(\'
Sad.'
winner just arrived, four hours after start.
40ish chasers at the finish line weren't sure anyone would make it at all, cheered greatly.
Oluwaseun crossed the finish line, bottle in hand, and gratefully accepted the awesome trophy and congratulations from all.
Apparently 52 eventually survived, although the number was still in the single digits by the time we left around 11:30 to walk back to our cars.
The best story, though, came from Beek when he finally arrived:
After checkpoint five he decided he needed to make up ground, so he ran at a full sprint the whole way from 5 to 6, dodging chasers left and right.
Eventually he ran into a pack of them at the Marriott, a block from 6, and was juking them with the aid of a giant pillar, when one of them yelled out, \STOP HIM!'
I'm not sure if this bellhop tackles people on a regular basis, or if he's just been waiting all his life to be the hero, or what, but in any case we've now decided that the term \bellhopped\' should be used to describe getting screwed
Analyzing the Journey
I couldn't help but analyze the game afterwards, and honestly, I loved it.
You had the obvious choice between wide and \safe\' routes versus direct and risky routes.'
You also had a choice between going full speed at the beginning to try and stay ahead of the growing pack of newly minted chasers (but then you're winded and you're encountering original chasers who are fresh) versus going slowly and hoping for safety in numbers.
The fact that the winner didn't come in until three and a half hours had elapsed says to me that it wasn't just about pure speed and athleticism, which is awesome.
Also, I always love the feeling of being a part of a game that's taking part on a grand scale right in the midst of people's everyday lives.
We had a bunch of people ask us what was going on (our answers ranged from \a race\' to \'a giant game of tag\') and everyone seeemd a little jealous that they weren't a part of it.'
It also totally transformed how I looked at the world, with my brain coming up with all sorts of unlikely scenarios about where chasers could be hiding or who might be undercover.
On top of that, the sense of camaraderie with fellow runners was tangible.
Thanks again to the illustrious Dax and all of the other organizers for setting this up!
I can't wait for the next one, and in the meantime some of these other tasks look rather interesting.
This story begins with two flat tires.
Not just any two flat tires, but two flat tires on a bike painted copper.
The reason I'd decided to bring my Burning Man bike to Journey was
a) it had regular pedals, unlike The Pretty Little Bomb, which meant I could wear regular shoes and get off said bike to chase runners.
b) it was procured freely, and therefore I could ride it as recklessly as I desired without worry of damaging my preferred mode of transportation.
c) should I have to abandon said bike to chase runners into the skyways, up into the trees, through fountains, or whatever sort of nonsense those nutty blue ribboned folk would go through, to remain blue ribboned.
Unfortunately, the bike painted copper's tires would not revive, so I made the decision to wear regular shoes in spite of the awkwardness of clippy pedals on my beloved bike, for the purpose of point a, above.
I knew, as the bike chaser, that I would be terrifying to those who might run from me, so I dressed as ridiculously as I could without endangering myself to the beginnings of Minnesota's autumn.
Pigtails, striped white socks, rolled up jeans, and a fuzzy pale blue cape were to be my costume of the evening.
I checked the air in my tires and unhitched the Pretty Little Bomb.
This bike is probably one of my most prized possessions, ranking almost on par with my camera.
I did bring my biking shoes.
just in case, and rode to the train station to catch a ride downtown.
This story continues with a third flat tire.
Upon getting off the train, my front tire made an awkward fwumph!
Sure enough, my front tire was flat.
I phoned my roommate and called in a favor I'd earned during the Minnesota Fringe Festival.
As we have almost exactly the same bike, and in the same size, this would not be the first time we'd traded wheels.
And then begins the game.
We will note, that at the beginning of the game, I was mostly there to spark the runners in the spirit of the game.
The staff chasers had a specific strategy that was to be adhered to during the course of the game, and would be updated by the head chaser, who would coordinate our efforts by phone.
Some failure lead to our head chaser not having a phone, but we checked in with B.
and a few of us did our own strategy later in the game.
It should be known to the poor people I chased up stairs and down an alley, I was just saying a friendly 'Boo.
'
In fact, my boo was so friendly that I dismounted and encouraged three hapless runners to run, when one of them decided he wanted more to chat with me and take my photograph.
This is not the single most infuriating moment of my Journey:MN experience.
The single most infuriating moment happened moments later, after more and more of my loudly yelling that they should run now.
No, Really, NOW.
And after finally walking up and tagging the fellow, his buddies would not even move beyond arm's length, which I politely requested.
I'm not exactly sure why this situation took place- whether they just wanted to be chasers from the start and rather than requesting to do so, preferred to undermine the system and create a hiccup in the game's structure, or whether they just didn't believe a girl in pigtails and a cape would tag them when she was yelling LOUDLY at them, or what, but, well.
let's just say there was a reason other than the layout of checkpoint two that it was hard to get to, and I feel bad that it was my fault for tagging the guys who didn't understand we had our chasers strategically placed not to create situations like that.
After that, I succeeded in scaring a few blues around Checkpoint 2 until meeting up with Oliver X.
It has been suggested that I might be a good person, because I retrieved a lost runner's manifest from some chasers who picked it up when he dropped it running from them, but reports of my good deedlyness are largely overstated, and I wouldn't trust a fiend with a red ribbon on her arm.
(you can see the pretty little bomb's reflection in the windows of a parking ramp stairwell.
)
We decided to move on to Checkpoint 3 and that part of the city.
We walked along the walkpath that accompanies the light rail line, hoping to see or spook some runners, and I think maybe we did.
Checkpoint 3 was uneventful, so I decided to check out Checkpoint 4 and leave Olly behind.
We both knew though, at that moment, I had dinosaur theft retaliation, burning in my heart.
I wanted Dax's ribbon.
Checkpoint 4 was clever, our man at a desk under a streetlight in the park.
I took the greenway to the checkpoint, which was still being set up, so I knew I was a bit early.
The checkpoint was near a corner of a long safezone, and the entirety of the park was rather dark, so it was hard to see approaching runners.
I did a couple loops of the area- different ways runners might approach.
I ended up mostly chasing people OUT of the park, and accidentally running a team of four blues through the greenway directly into the arms of another mob of chasers.
I requested for the chasers to stay in that area, so that I could make my way to Checkpoint 5 and see how that was going.
But first I did a little tour of the park.
(And accidentally chased some people who weren't playing.
)

Checkpoint 5, an I was sure I had some time, after harassing a blue or two and Jjason, the checkpoint agent, so I ordered myself a coffee.
No sooner did I have coffee in hand but Oliver X phoned me to tell me he was tracking Dax and his posse of Chicago and suburbs from Checkpoint 3, and that I should head them off.
I hopped atop my bomb and jetted back towards downtown, sucking down the espresso as I pedaled and talked on the phone.
'They're crossing Marquette now.
'  Oliver informed me.
'They're to Nicollet, I'm not sure if they turned onto Nicollet or crossed it.
'  I started about 2 miles from where he was at, so I was biking like a demon to head off the Chi-town posse.
'They didn't turn on Nicollet.
They're heading towards Hennepin.
'
Downtown was a portion of the Journey that meant that I actually had to navigate between Saturday night dancers and diners I turned down Hennepin and biked through the traffic heading towards Loring Park.
'I don't think they turned on Hennepin,' Olly called in, 'I think they're heading towards First Ave.
'  But something in my chaser senses was tingling, and I kept on Hennepin, scanning the crowd before I spotted Dax's telltale pigtails (And still I hear them beating!
), paying fare inside a city bus headed directly for me.
I flagged down the bus, mounted my bike to the front and got on.
Not just Dax: the bus was rife with blue and yellow ribbons.
'Oh shit,' someone murmurred.
'It's a chaser.
'
Dax looked at me, 'That's not just any chaser.
'  (Probably the best compliment of the night.
)
In retrospect, I could have just followed the bus on bike, and tagged each of them as they exited, but my role as bike chaser included maximal scare tactics, so I got on.
Dax was unnecessarily kind, and helped me pay my fare.
I grinned at them as they groaned in nervousness and anticipation.
Dax exited early, either thinking I'd stay with the mass of ribbons and he could slip out unnoticed, or knowing I had it in for him, he sacrificed himself to the impending dinosaur theft retribution.
Those who Journeyed, know I followed.
First, he leapt over a low wall and crouched down, hoping either I'd try to follow on my bike and get slowed down, or hiding, or whatnot.
I simply pointed in the opposite direction and yelled, 'The checkpoint is that way.
'
And so began the chase.
We went over hills, around trees, over curbs.
Street, sidewalk, grass, mud, everything.
But Dax didn't know where the safe zone was, and headed directly away from it towards.
a port-a-potty.
Now, there are things we all do in that moment of terror, just anything to put a wall between onesself and one's pursuer, but this one made me giggle a little.
I dismounted my bike, opened the door, and Dax- in the fight or flight mode, opportunity of flight nullified, kicked me in the boob.
'You kicked me in the boob!
' I said, startled, and tagged him.
I took his yellow ribbon, pointed him in the direction of the checkpoint and headed there myself.
This story concludes with a fourth flat tire.
All of the yellow-ribboned Chi-town kids were arriving before I could catch them, having dismounted, and I was hugged into not catching another large crew of yellow and blue ribboned runners.
WHERE MY CHASERS IS AT?
WHERE THE  MY CHASERS AT?
Let go, I dashed at one straggling runner from the second group, failed to tag and turned around to see what seemed to be a crowd of runners huddled around my bike.
I began swearing and acting irrationally, because, well, I love my bike.
Enough to have written it a love poem for slam.
Bike Love
foot bone connected to the pedal bone
the pedal bone's connected to the gear bone
the gear bone's connected to the chain bone
the chain bone's connected to the wheel bone
the wheel bone's connected to the road bone
and I feel my whole body and musculature 
connected through this movement machine
this pretty little bullet
this road-flight bird-beast is me and I am flying
I wanna feel like that
when you pick me up in your arms
your arm bones connected to my back bones
my ear bone connected to your ear bone
my chest bone connected to your chest bone
part of the same machine
the purpose for which we still have not determined
some temporary singularity.
And I'm not saying that there aren't going to be some problems.
I have gone over the hood of a car, 
I have gone skittering across the pavement more than once
I have found myself twisted in something that will no longer move muchless fly
But I have yet to break one bone
or abandon biking for some less dangerous form of movement.
These scrapes and scratches are part of the deal.
So pick me up and hold me,
and make me feel like I am flying down city streets,
that you might respond to a shift in my weight
and make great avian swoops
or clever sideswipes of potholes or debris in our way
And if we seem to be straining against some hill
I can downshift,
or you could put me down and just move along side me.
I have scars and hesitance
but no fear
where my voice shakes
my body is strong
and my silence should not be a sign of nothing to say
only that it may not be my voice that is speaking.
I do not wear my heart on my sleeve,
I ride it on city streets.
And I am a graceful machine when exhausted
I am a wind in and out of street lights
I am legs and wheels, lungs and gears.
I am a sure machine when drunk
bent like a rocket to be close to the road
The shoulder bone connected to the arm bone
the arm bone connected to the wrist bone
the wrist bone connected to the hand bone
the hand bone connected to the brake bone
the brake bone connected to the wheel bone
and the foot bone reunited with the street, once again two separate entities.
So hold me in your arms and join our motivations
I have no destination in mind
I only want to start moving

As I chased after the mass exodus, my roommate's front wheel made that sickening fwumph!
noise, and I felt heartbreak, both at the worry I'd done something awful to the bike, and at the knowledge that I would not be able to play the game further, as I could not abandon the Pretty Little Bomb at Checkpoint 4 and hoof it.
So I made my way towards the final checkpoint, but not before giving Oliver X the heads up on where CG0 was headed next.
I called Dax, and he affirmed that he'd deflated my front tire- it took me several hours and team Fuck Yeah's gentle prodding to cool down and laugh about it, but I can now say I have a Real reason to once again seek retribution.
That winged foot to the boob and stab at my heart (my bike, that is) beg some sort of comeuppance.
All in all, a lovely evening.
I was pleased to do brunch with CG0 and fiends the next day, and embark on some other  very charming adventures shortly thereafter.
An interpretation of the journey to the end of the night:
The sun was setting on the Embarcadero as we embarked.
A crew of four, initially at least, we boarded the trains to our first destination.
The cars filled quickly.
Shoulder to shoulder we stood.
Quickly we noticed how many of our fellow passengers also wore the blue armband of wanted men (and women).
The discussions on board soon turned to those of betrayal.
Who would be our friends?
Who would be our foes?
At least with the reds, we knew where we stood.
A group of Blues got off a stop before our intended stop.
Did they know more than we did?
Were they just trying to throw us off?
We decided, hesitantly, to stay on board and try our luck at the next stop.
Apparently, they weren't trying to throw us off.
A peril of using a GPS is the lack of notation for elevation.
We weren't equipped with climbing gear.
Our goal was within reach, if only we had brought our pitons.
We took the long way around, but in doing so ended up not seeing a single Red.
The climb up the hill was rough and I, being the least burdened, sprinted on ahead, bearing the deliveries for the entire crew.
The top was a welcome respite, inhabited by many fellow Blues and lorded (and ladied) over by a kindly couple who distributed much needed refreshments and signatures.
Here, I waited for my teammates.
After nearly 20 minutes of waiting, I began to ask the Blues who had been ascending the peak if they heard news of my beleaguered colleagues.
'A man with a stick was seen sprinting down Kearny.
He may have been Red already.
' That was my man with a stick.
On that note, I decided it was folly to wait any longer if the Reds had already gotten to the rest of the team.
It was a mistake, I decried, to have left them!
Now, they were in those vile clutches!
During my descent, I encountered what remained of my team.
Jason, the man with the stick, was gone.
I informed the others that their evidence was left with the kindly couple and that I would wait for them to retrieve it.
Spying my first Red in the distance encouraged me to leave.
I felt bad about leaving the others again, but my own safety was at stake!
It had to be done!
I had no choice!
On the trek through Chinatown, I heard an ominous cry.
'Red Robin!
Red Robin!
' A flash of red, only the width of a street away!
I sprinted away.
The fear of the Reds had caused me to miss my one opportunity to save myself.
At the next safe house, I didn't stay long.
I felt if I kept my momentum, I'd be one step ahead of that scarlet horde.
But one block from the safe house, while passing in front of a garage, a man stopped.
He was right in front of me, not more than two paces.
He stepped left.
I stepped left.
I saw his arm.
I turned!
I sprinted!
My heart raced!
But I made it.
I just smiled at him as he returned to whatever sort of hideous lair those monsters keep.
I decided to make my way through the alleys.
I felt it safer than keeping to the main thoroughfares.
I worked my way down to Broadway, ducking between cars, pressed up against walls.
Everywhere I looked I could see Reds.
They looked back.
It seemed like a Red tassel was always occupying a corner of my vision.
Walking down Broadway, I started to relax.
I changed to a slower gait, trying to regain some energy, sure that I would be safe, if only for a few blocks.
Then I heard a familiar sound.
thump thump thump thump.
Falling footsteps!
Faster and faster!
I turned and saw his awful mug.
I was off!
A crowd of civilians clogged the sidewalk.
Deftly sidestepping, twirling and twisting, I bound between them.
A group of elderly women was ahead, but like Moses at the Red Sea, they parted, allowing me to slip through to salvation.
And like that crooked Pharaoh, they sealed up and swallowed my pursuer.
'The tunnel!
The tunnel!
' I heard him cry.
His mistake to reveal his intentions.
I ducked up the stairs to avoid whatever awaited me in the dark.
So proud of myself, I smirked, flipped my hair back, and fell in to a stroll.
My pursuer defeated, I had little to worry about.
I dusted myself off and started making my way towards the third destination.
I was close, not more than three or four blocks away, when I once again heard that awful sound.
He was already at full speed, and I was winded from the previous chase.
I felt my legs give.
No pain, just a revolt from my lower half.
They would not operate.
I turned in to a driveway behind a large brick wall and hunched down.
His footsteps slowed, and he came around the corner.
A look of defeat crossed his face.
He was staring up the street, hoping to catch a glimpse of me.
But then, as he turned away, he drew his vision up the driveway and saw me crouching.
I ran up the driveway.
Where else could I have gone?
We ended up on opposite sides of a parked car.
We began to circle, like some sort of sick parody of a 1940's cartoon.
A nervous banter began.
'The next destination is a grocery store' I mentioned 'and I bet they have bagels.
You look like you need a bagel.
' 'I would like a bagel.
' 'How about a deal: One bagel for my salvation?
' I was naÃ¯ve.
You can never make a deal with these cretins.
'Let's shake on it.
' He extended his hand across the car.
I laughed at his sorry attempt to deceive me.
Their reputation for deception most certainly did not imply cleverness.
We continued to circle around the car.
I peered over the brick wall and realized that a 35 foot drop to the cement would be as perilous as his catching me.
But as we came around and around, he ended up stuck between the bumper and the wall.
My nimbleness allowed me to slip between the two, but he didn't have that luxury.
While he was stuck, I sprinted down that driveway.
He had extracted himself and began after me.
I soon remembered my initial reason for hiding behind that wall.
I ducked into an alley, attempting to lose him by ending up on another block.
No chance.
The alley ended in a solid brick wall.
I was devastated, but not yet ready to give up.
There appeared to be a path leading left, behind a building!
I ran in, but instead found myself in an alcove not more than the size of a square meter.
I heard his breathing.
He had followed me in to the alley, and it would only be a matter of time now.
When he caught up to me, I was clawing at the walls, trying my best to climb up the sheer surfaces.
Everything faded to black.
 That will be a story for another time.
Are we surprised?
Not likely.
I may seem more refined in writing and praxis, but I assure you, I'm fairly impish.
It started in the amphitheater in Mosswood Park.
Nicole, Ian and I walked the few short blocks from home.
Nearly every seat in the place was filled and standing people took the space close to the stage.
Casual chatting.
Tying on armbands.
Looking at maps.
Dax, on a megaphone explained the rules.
Your armband must be visible.
You must go to the checkpoints in order.
You may travel on foot or on public transit.
The city doesn't know the game is happening, and it shouldn't need to know.
Cars are still real.
There was about two hundred of us at the start, all running from the amphitheater, towards the first checkpoint, at the top of a hill.
I ran up West MacArthur.
Neon pink bunny ears poked out from behind a building and I had a few second's warning before Qarly rode out from the other side on her bike.
While she circled a few of the slower ones, I darted across the street.
A group of three people waited at the corner for the light to change.
We walked together under the freeway and continued up the hill, following smaller streets, through neighborhoods.
I hid in someone's garden as Rubin  rode down the hill, his face covered with a mask, orange ribbons trailing in the wind.
I was alone.
The first checkpoint was about a block away.
I could see a player with an orange armband standing at the end of the street, guarding the entrance to the park.
Another green ran towards him, making a desperate run for the rose garden.
He was tagged.
A new orange ran up the hill.
I scrambled up the ramp of a moving truck.
When all of the oranges were occupied, I bolted up the hill and ducked behind a car.
Joe, all dressed in black, with orange ribbons fluttering in the wind walked slowly down the middle of the street.
He didn't see me.
Checkpoint 1 was so close.
As I ran to an entrance, I heard loud footsteps coming up behind me.
An orange girl.
These stairs lead into the garden, but we're too close together and I'm not a good runner.
I dove into the ivy, sliding and rolling to the bottom.
And I was on my feet again, not looking back.
Fortune tellers waited at the top of another set of stairs.
They sat at a table, cards spread out before them.
Choose a card with your left hand.
My card was the Magician.
I always get a card from the Major Arcana, and the Magician is a familiar one.
She said, the magician is a good card for this game.
The Magician does not wish he had things that he does not, but he bends the environment to suit his purposes.
I would do well to channel the Magician during the game.
She stamped my map.
I thanked her and stood up from the table.
Ian and Ed were covered in dusty things and cobwebs.
They followed a creek through the sewer to get to the other side of the freeway.
Nicole and Kai had been tagged already.
Colin too.
Oranges hovered at the edges of the safe zone.
We'd need to find another way out.
It became clear that any friends we haven't seen in a while could no longer be trusted.
Jason, Ian, Ed, and I clung to a fence and climbed through various forms of plantlife.
Where we came out to the sidewalk again seemed clear.
Four turned into two on each side of the street, signaling to each other when it was safe to continue.
Checking first to make sure it wasn't a trap, we ran across the bridge over the freeway, bodies low, trying to conceal ourselves behind the guardrail.
The freeway spread out beneath our feet.
The sun's orange-pink glow flooded over the rush of cars.
This, a city I've lived in for nearly three years, is still largely unfamiliar to me.
So much is still new.
More walking, running, and hiding behind things.
The area started to look more familiar.
We were near Whole Foods, close to Lake Merritt.
Through a parking lot, through thorn bushes, over a fence, and back onto the ground again.
A girl asked, what were we doing?
Jason happened to know her.
We're playing a game.
That was enough of an explanation for her.
We continued on.
We crossed a street and were in the safe zone - the complete wrong end of the safe zone, but we were safe, so it didn't matter.
We found Dax at checkpoint 7.
We were looking for checkpoint 2, where we'd meet the unlikely, cross-dressing fishermen in formalwear.
Orange construction fences were trampled.
A woman in a suit and a man in a dress greeted us there, at the edge of the water, and signed our maps.
Someone warned us not to travel along Lakeshore.
It was a killing zone.
We had hoped to catch a bus, but there were oranges between us and the stop.
Our path took us up into hills and smaller streets.
It was getting dark.
It was no longer obvious from a distance if people were green, orange, or if they were players at all.
Up a staircase, climbing two stairs at a time.
Running down the hill on the other side.
Jason and Ian were ahead of Ed and I.
We crashed through the weeds of a median to rejoin them in front of the Leaning Tower of Pizza.
I remembered being twelve, making similiar moves through the dead zone between Washington DC and Arlington.
It feels like a lifetime ago, but I still remember the plants scratching at my bare legs, the hiding in the shadows waiting for Uncle Kenny to return with news about crossing some highway or another.
Back to the now.
Back to Oakland.
I wondered where other friends were.
Who has been tagged?
Who is still going?
It would be unwise to try and make contact.
Phones will only get us in trouble now.
And up another hill.
There were a few people on the other side of the street, talking to each other.
We couldn't tell if they were players or not.
Their silohettes gave no information.
In any case, they didn't seem to notice us at all.
We continued on, trying to keep it that way.
They noticed us after we had passed them slightly.
Ian was the first to run.
A girl came after me and I ran into the street.
Her momentum looped her around a car and then back after me again.
In a last sloppy effort to save myself, I thought I could tumble over the edge of a car's hood and lose her.
I just ran into the car and she grabbed my back.
I became a chaser and immediately looked for anyone who hadn't been tagged yet.
No loyalties here.
Ed was tagged too.
Ian and Jason were nowhere to be seen.
Ed and I travelled together, trying to come up with strategies for catching people.
We sought out the path that Ian chose to bring our group to Checkpoint 3.
We arrived at the checkpoint without seeing many greens along the way.
We had lemonade and greeted other friends as they filtered into the park.
Skippy and Evan's group was doing pretty well, taking long routes around everything.
Ed and I looked for a bus, but ultimately ended up walking along the edge of the lake, all the way to Checkpoint 4.
It was near Lake Merritt BART.
We looked around for anyone exiting the station.
Ed chased Cubes as he left what we thought was the safe zone.
I turned around and walked as casually as I could back toward the station.
Evan ran away from some other orange and directly into my arms.
A closer look at the map revealed that we were in a safezone.
We continued on to Checkpoint 4.
Last we heard from Slim, he was there.
He said he was still green.
But that didn't really mean anything - was he green, or just saying that.
We were just saying it.
He left by the time we arrived.
But there was Minotaur, dressed in latex and leather, at the center of a chalk labyrinth in the glow of streetlights.
Greens had to battle her and take the ring from her nose before they could get a signature and move along to the next checkpoint.
We rested for a short time.
Eden became orange right before this checkpoint and joined us.
We shared stories of coming to the Bay Area, how each of our lives made the appropriate turns.
There was a tangle of freeway onramps and offramps to cross.
It looked like a closed sidewalk would lead to a bridge of sorts.
I stepped around the sleeping man, over the gate, and onto a cracking sidewalk.
Shortly after the corresponding barricade on the other side, the sidewalk ended.
Oh well, at least we tried.
Since the traffic wasn't heavy at that time of night, we waited for it to break and we ran for the safety of the orange barriers on the lake side.
We were aiming for the clusterfuck of streets in the triangle formed by checkpoints 4, 5, and 6.
We walked along Broadway for some time.
And in an outdoor mall, there was a bit of excitement as an orange chased a green over a fountain and then back out again.
We heard from some others about a resurrection phone near checkpoint 6.
It was around here somewhere, and probably already closed down, but it was worth checking it out.
On the other side of the mall, we ran into a guy who had been tagged right outside of Checkpoint 7.
He was resurrected and then was tagged again.
So now he was nothing, a floating spirit.
We examined the map to figure out where Eden's old group might go on their journey from 5 to 6.
There were several choke points since not all the streets passed under the freeway.
That seems sufficiently far from the obvious Broadway path.
And once again I experience the city at night.
Under moonlight and tungsten.
I lacked the patience to stand still and wait for them.
I paced up and down the block.
It felt like the game was over.
There wasn't anyone left to chase, and it was getting close to midnight.
We made our way to Checkpoint 7.
I kept my eyes open for any greens running in.
Though it would really be a dick move to grab someone that close to the end, it would be hilarious to scare them.
Tired and achey, we walked to the last checkpoint.
Lights and shadows.
The maps was projected into the space.
Checking to see who finished with each armband.
Skippy, Evan, and Lee made it, along with some others.
The walk back to Cakebread from Lake Merritt seemed insignificant when compared to the rest of the night.
It was a relatively small gathering - just the organizers, those of us who live here, and a few other friends.
Ian's feet were bright green because his green shoes got wet.
Everyone had collapsed onto some surface or another.
A few people were stretching crampy muscles.
We shared food and stories of the night.
The minotaur was charmed by the white flower given to her by Slim.
Morley's noble sacrafice allowed Lee to finish the game.
Ian got caught while hiding from greens.
Rubin had some bike adventures chasing people.
The stories continued the next morning as all of us woke up again.
My experience of the city is forever changed.
The concept of a reasonable path and what counts as a way out have expanded greatly.
The links of friendship are stronger with shared experience.
And though there are many people I saw only briefly, the experience runs parallel.
We took different paths, but we all did this together.
And in the days of recovery, we are all similarly sore - slight whining, with a knowing smile.
just a few short words.
the fifty-four vegan cupcakes for checkpoint one were really fun to bake while listening to architecture in helsinki.
i sat at a little dive for a long time with dan miller, but that's nothing new for me.
this might also be remembered as checkpoint three, the billy goat cafe, yellow and green, the place where a large majority of players got caught.
so many sweaty people!
one of the workers was really into whatever we were doing.
my favorite part of the entire night: seeing my friend robert really, truly happy for the first time in about two years.
he claims running journey to the end of the night changed his life, and i absolutely believe it.
halfway through freshman year of college he had to go back to tennessee because his dad died.
his family's been going through a really rough time ever since.
the entire reason robert was in chicago during journey was to try and get back to school and make a life for himself away from a place that didn't ever really feel like home and wasn't necessarily getting any better.
after journey, i saw such a complete rejuvination of motivation and excitement in him it was wonderful and contagious!
he's back in tenessee for a bit, but i'm sure he'll be back when the next one rolls around.
thanks, dax, for setting up such a gloriously life-changing event!
it really was a beautiful new view of things.
I joined Journy to the end of the night on May 11th when it luckily came to London.
I didn't know what I was getting myself into.
I was invited by a friend (who ended up not showing).
I knew where I had to be and that I should wear my running shoes, but that was pretty much all.
Luckily, my fiance decided at the last minute to accompany me.
)  We headed for the event, not knowing what to expect.
I'm not overly familiar with the city and my sense of direction is terrible.
I got turned around on my way to the start point, so the idea of wandering around the city while being chased was a bit eerie.
At the beginning, we decided there was safety in numbers.
We picked a big group of runners, and stayed toward the center.
There was no way the chasers on bikes could tag us all.
When a chaser came toward us, the whole group surged into a train station.
I tripped, but managed to catch myself- it would have been just my luck if I'd twisted my ankle less than five minutes into the game.
When the chaser had passed, we all streamed out of the station, and the group split up.
My fiance and I headed directly for the first check point, and made it there with no major problems.
The crowd split up a bunch more after the first check point.
There was a chaser on a bike at the corner, and we waited for him to go after another group before running across the street.
We swung by 7-11 on the way to the second check point to pick up some water, and I was tasked with watching the door in case a chaser came in.
After leaving 7-11, I managed to go the wrong way three times before finally finding my way to the second check point.
After the second check point we decided to take the side streets.
Since we didn't know our way around and I seemed determined to get us lost, we picked a set of players who seemed to know where they were going and followed them.
We were about a block and a half behind them, and there was a small group of players about the same distance behind us.
We kept an eye on both groups so we could duck down an alley if either started running.
The players in front of us turned to head toward the check point, and we turned a block before them, keeping an eye on them between buildings whenever we could.
I saw one of them tying on a pink ribbon, and we turned to run back the other way, but another chaser had circled back behind us.
He caught my fiance, and I started to run, but hesitated when I realized that I had no idea where I was, and the chaser caught me.
After we handed over our ribbons, we decided to skip ahead to a later check point.
There were chasers as far as the eye could see around check point 3, and we thought there might be less later on.
That might have been a mistake.
All we saw for the next couple hours was more chasers.
Some of them were pretty clever.
We walked past what I took to be a couple.
The girl was eating pizza and the guy was walking a dog.
I didn't even notice that the guy had a pink ribbon until my fiance pointed it out - I was too distracted by the adorable dog.
Well played, dog walking guy.
After a couple hours of fruitless (but fun) wandering, we decided to head to the red line.
I think there was a closer station, but I was so lost by that point that I just wanted someplace familiar.
(Note to self - buy map and compass.
)
We hardly saw anyone on our way - the streets were pretty deserted.
Right outside the Sox station we saw a bus stop and pick somebody up.
I happened to glance up as the bus went by, and I saw that the guy who had just boarded had a blue ribbon.
I was cursing myself for being so slow and unstealthy - I totally could have caught that guy!
We considered hanging out by the station in case other players came out, but it was getting late, and we didn't want to lurk suspiciously in an unfamiliar neighborhood, so we headed home.
Lessons I learned:
1- If I'm ever being hunted, I hope that it's in my home town.
Knowing the territory is an incalculable advantage.
2- I'm not cut out for a life of crime.
I'm terrible at acting nonchalant.
Yesterday My buddyâ??s facebook status message said â??skip the bar tonight and do something WAY betterâ?.
Attached was a link to a mysterious sounding event called â??Journey to the end of the Nightâ?
Now, I am the type of person that has to fight back the overwhelming urge to touch art in art museums.
You know, the guy  who HAS to touch the wet paint even though the sign says â??wet paintâ?.
Basically, I canâ??t resist anything shrouded in mystery, so, being that this Facebook status message was completely and utterly shrouded in mystery, I clicked the link wondering what in the world could possibly be more fun on a Saturday night than heading to super-fratty Wrigleyville, Chicago bars chocked full of awesome Turbos and Trixies?
So I clicked the link and it turns out, Journey to the end of the Night, is a giant city-wide game â??of epic proportionâ? that takes place in Chicago and a handful of other cities around the world.
Mucho Awesome!
You can read the rest of these misadventures in Chicago at Youthnoise, Play City.
Mucho bueno!
My quest ended up being a solo endeavor.
I originally teamed up with my beau, but he got caught right before the entrance to checkpoint #2.
I skillfully managed to avoid capture by faking a chaser out around a Volvo.
Once he was successfully faked out and running the wrong direction around the car, I bolted to the metal fence, grabbed the bar at the end, and swung around, finally getting to the door in a panting mess.
Shit, my water.
My water was in my former-partner's backpack.
I knew that would happen if one of us got caught, I just hadn't expected it so soon.
Luckily, he was nice.
And though he was now a chaser, he dropped into the safe zone to hand me a water bottle.
Leaving was another story.
I saw a group of people enter and decided that they were my new team.
When we left, there were chasers swarming around outside.
We used the traffic to our advantage, bolting across the street when cars allowed, and stranding the chasers on the other side as traffic started coming again.
We went out of our way, but finally got headed in the right direction, sprinting for 2 blocks.
It was then obvious that the chasers had lost us.
We semi-jogged, semi-walked for another two blocks until a chaser appeared from a side-street.
I must have looked like an easy catch, because though I was the furthest away at one point, the chaser went after me.
One of my new teammates valiantly tried to tempt the chaser to chase him instead, but it didn't work.
I screamed 'SHIT!
' in about the squeakiest voice I've ever heard out of myself, and attempted to sprint from my eventual doom.
I surrendered my runner tape while the rest of my new team ran off to safety?
I wonder if I had attempted to continue solo how things would have ended up.
Would I have somehow escaped unnoticed?
Probably not.
Would I have gotten myself lost?
It's still worth pondering.
I was now teamed with two chasers.
We slowly made our way to the Lightrail station, assuming that would be a well-utilized way to get into downtown.
Two runners (teamed with two chasers?
) joined us at the station, just as a train was approaching.
Shoot, they were safe!
They got off the train one stop later than they would have to get to the next checkpoint.
We got off at the same time.
Given that they had 15 seconds to escape and some partners, we decided to go to another check point and scope it out.
We walked past check point #6 and headed to check point #4, where we met up with a couple of runners.
I tagged one of them.
One of my co-chasers tagged another, but she was wearing a re-spawn ribbon (what?
) which she tried to give to my co-chaser and which the co-chaser rejected.
At that point, I was really hungry, so I left those chasers to pursue a Chipotle.
I met up with my coworker Seth (another chaser) on the way, and we got tacos.
After that, we spent the rest of our time stalking the last checkpoint, but never managing to catch anyone.
The runner-chaser team made it to last checkpoint first.
And then we went to the party.
And then I went to sleep.
As this was my first first-hand experience with Journey, I chose to volunteer and learn the event from the inside.
Besides it wouldnâ??t be fair to compete considering my unparalleled athletic prowess.
This is my story to tell.
Iâ??ll sidestep the less glamorous side of volunteer activities such as ribbon cutting except to say:  The view of Chicago at sunset from the roof of the Marina Towers is spectacular though beyond the talents of my camera phone to capture.
Thank you Tam for opening your home to us for the evening and the many, many hours of planning and organizing!
For the actual event, I was placed under the leadership of Megin and her Ladies Auxiliary Literary Society at checkpoint two along the Chicago River at Kingsbury and Weed.
Each member of the LALS was in a period costume of their choosing:  Edwardian, Victorian, WWII, etc.
We would greet each Journey participant as a distinguished visiting author.
In order to pass our checkpoint and continue on their journey, authors could perform one of several tasks for the amusement of the Society:  Add a line to the exquisite corpse, recite a poem, or sing along with the band.
Thatâ??s right, I said, â??bandâ?.
The fabulous Ms.
Carol (who also deserves all credit for the photos in this praxis) invited the apocalypse folk group The Afterlife to play and entertain, and they were a treat indeed!
Between the lovely river view, safety from chasers, proximity of Lincoln Parkâ??s Whole Foods, bewitching tunes of The Afterlife, and of course, the costumed literati, checkpoint two seemed to be a popular hangout for many players as well as a few random bystanders.
Too bad there were still five checkpoints remaining before Journeyâ??s End.
Heh heh heh.
A few quick shout outs to Mike and Marcus for braving The Journey to its final destination as well as the unknown (to me) players who:  breathlessly recited a full page of Shakespeare, recited a poem in flawless German,  and flirted shamelessly with the Ladies Auxiliary Literary Societyâ??s sole â??hen-peckedâ? male.
Thank you for a wonderful evening!
My friend Melissa (not an SF0 player) and I womanned the third checkpoint on the Manhattan Bridge as the 'two girls in dresses.
'  We barely got to the bridge in time to catch the first player--on a bike, which is why he was earlier than we expected.
Fortunately, he didn't seem to gather that we weren't out of breath from the excitement of the game but rather because we'd been spending the last 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get on the damn bridge, hopping construction fences and the like.
He said to us, 'Wow, they said to look for two girls in dresses, and here you are, two girls in dresses,' which I assume means he was feeling the magic.
(Getting to the bridge was also a bit stressful, as we were running late and had to take a cab.
The driver seemed a little put out by our request that he just drop us at the bottom of the Manhattan Bridge on the Brooklyn side so that we could walk across it.
I'm not familiar with non-Romance languages, but I'm pretty sure he said something derogatory about us into his cell phone.
)
In any case, Melissa and I had a good time.
When we got bored we took pictures of each other and stared at the view, punctuated by players running/walking up to us and the subway trains passing behind us.
It was weirdly objectifying to just be dressed up and acting like ourselves (plus the job of signing and kissing pieces of paper), and have other people impose some sort of urban-chase-magic on us.
A girl I knew from Berkeley (Nora, sorry we didn't get any pics of your group!
) didn't even recognize me.
Strangely, there was one guy who seemed to just be jogging around on the bridge in jeans--we tried staring at him really hard and quasi-flagging him down in case he was a player, but apparently he was only exercising.
Here's some pictures.
Since most of our time was spent running in terror and not documenting, FOEcakes is sharing our pool of photos amongst ourselves, which explains why you might see some repetition amongst praxii.
Prologue
up to 7:30pm
In which we gather, arrive at the park, and begin.
Team FOEcakes has been looking forward to Journey to the End of the Night since we first heard it would be held in Chicago.
Running howling through the night, climbing over things, scaring the living daylights out of people?
Nothing could be better.
Except perhaps doing all those things and defeating some cakes, our sworn foes.
A bunch of us met up beforehand and had some light food.
I met a few new people who were going to be playing as well, and several of us swapped cellphone numbers (which would come very much in handy, later).
The FOEcakes mentioned in this praxis are:
Meredithian
Mr.
G (praxis)
Sparrows Fall
Gremlin
LittleMonk (praxis)
Rex (praxis)
Jane Flash (praxis)
Ms.
Goblinpants
Sprite (praxis)
Antisocialite
Amby D (praxis)
Many other people of the kickass persuasion are also mentioned in this praxis:
Dax
Zer0gee
Ninja (praxis)
Sean Mahan (praxis)
Lara Black (praxis)
Myrna Minx (praxis)
Terpsichore (praxis)
Spidere (praxis)
Oliver X (praxis)
Ink Tea (praxis)
Yas (praxis)
Beetle Bomb (praxis)
Star5 (praxis)
JJason (praxis)
Other fantastic, scary, and amazing people whose names I do not know, and so cannot be mentioned there.
We headed out to the park and got to meet Zer0gee in person, which was great:

We signed up and ribboned up, then milled around and waited to hear Dax's speech.
Sparrows Fall, Mr.
G, and Meredithian had some concerns about the upcoming game - would we even make it to the first checkpoint?
We had read previous praxii - people had GPS, and several different maps, and all these amazing plans.
We had our feet, and a lot of anxiety.
We were doomed.
Our attention was glued to Dax when he began to speak Dax, are you going to put your speech up in a praxis?
It was great to listen to, and I know I was wishing I had a voice recorder on me or somethingâ?¦ - Sparrows.
Dax gave us the rules, and few additional suggestions - cars were just as dangerous on this night as they were any other night.
Some of the chasers are on bikes - this is fair.
Do not jump off bridges, unless it is something you do regularly and are comfortable with.
Then it was time.
JJason is in this shot:

There was one perfect moment of stillness in the grey evening of the afternoon, around the gaping and empty fountain.
Dax stood above us, hundreds of eyes on him, the whole crowd encircling him and poised, as if the world had drawn in a breath and held it, bracing, until â?? 
'GO!
'
Like a piece of expensive porcelain hitting the floor, the crowd broke, transforming from something beautiful and frozen to hundreds of scattering shards - fast, in small pieces, irrevocable.
And we were off.
From Start to Checkpoint 1
7:30pm to 8:10pm
In which we have tense brushes with chasers, say hi to the po-po, unsettle our friends, and consume vegan cupcakes.
G, Meredithian and I (Sparrows Fall) took off south, while the majority of FOEcakes took a southwesterly route out of the park (where they were soon to meet with their own set of hair-raising circumstances.
But that's their story to tell).
There were two blues in front of us:

And two blues behind us:

Even though we tried to set out in a less popular direction, we kept hitting other small groups of blue-banded runners as we went, people's paths tangling up in each other again and again.
There was an animal energy in the air - we were wired and jumpy, sometimes slowing down before every trash can, sometimes striding out of an alleyway without even thinking to look.
We decided we'd keep off the main streets, and try to stay in the alleys.
A freeway lay like an impassible concrete river between us and Checkpoint 1.
There were three crossings.
Two were major â?? North, Division â?? and one small â?? Augusta.
We went for the small crossing, thinking that chasers wouldn't have been placed as heavily there.
Meredithian's tendency to keep looking behind us landed her rearguard duty.
G took lead, and I kept a paranoid eye on trashcans, doorways, intersecting mini-alleys, and crevices between buildings.
For a time, things were uneventfully tense.
We reached Augusta and turned left, heading toward the freeway.
On the way we passed a police van, and one of the officers called us over gruffly.
'What are these blue bands?
Someone ran by with a blue band on a minute ago.
Why are they running?
'
We said we had no idea why someone would be running, and that the blue bands meant we were in a scavenger hunt, which satisfied him.
We reached the Augusta bridge and paused, wary.
We were certain chasers were waiting to bracket people on either side of the thing, once they'd gotten to far onto it to be able to escape.
But another two blues crossed ahead of us unharmed, so we ran for it.
As soon as we were across we got off the road and into some trees, clearing them just in time to see the two blues sprint southward in the distance, as someone on a bike shot off in the same direction.
Was this one of the bike chasers we had been warned about?
(It turns out the bike chaser was Beetle Bomb, and you should check some of the other praxii, including hers, for some terrifying stories.
)
We continued straight ahead, figuring that if the cyclist was a chaser, we wanted to go any direction but south.
We made it down the road a bit, and almost to the edge of the safe zone â?? all we had to do was make it around a high wall and up about a block.
But something felt wrong (Who am I kidding?
Everything felt wrong the whole time - paranoia does that.
), and we heard a voice.
The speaker stood just around the corner from us.
G crept up on the wall, hunched down and moving slowly.
Six feet from the corner he swung around, eyes wide, and with one furious gesture motioned us into the alleyway behind us as he began to run.
A chaser had stood just on the other side of the corner, and had called in on their cell to check in with Spidere, giving away their position.
Without that, we would have walked right into them.
We hauled ass down the alley, into the center of some kind of taxi distribution lot.
Taxis were driving out, with people motioning them in and out of parking spaces and yelling at us to get the hell out.
We spilled out of the taxi area and into the safe zone of the first checkpoint.
We had made it.
We were trotting up to the checkpoint when a chaser came walking slowly down the road toward us.
He wore a red bandana and sunglasses.
We stopped.
He kept coming.
We looked at each other.
We were in the safe zone, right?
We asked him.
He said yes.
We still made a wide circuit around him, and he laughed.
This was not the last time we would see him.
We got our manifests signed and sat panting.
The checkpoint folks (Sean Mahan and Lara Black!
) gave us the next clue - we were looking for a tea party beneath an underpass.
Formal dress.
I forgot to take a picture at this checkpoint â?? sorry guys, adrenaline has a tendency to wipe out my planning circuits.
G had a vegan cupcake.
I should have had a vegan cupcake.
While we were here, my phone rang â?? it was Rex, who'd gone with the big group of FOEcakes.
'Where are you?
' he asked.
'We're at the first checkpoint.
Where are you?
'
'Between the first and second.
We're alone, everyone's gone.
'
'Shit, they're all caught?
They're all chasers?
' I asked.
'I don't know.
One of them charged into us, and went right for Little Monk, and we scattered.
'
'Are you and Jane okay?
' I asked.
There was a wary pause on the phone.
'How do you know I'm with Jane?
' he asked.
'You sat next to each other at the restaurant.
I figured if the group broke you guys would stick together.
'
'Are you lying?
Can you see me right now?
Are you a chaser?
'
'I can't see you.
Dude, I'm at the first checkpoint.
'
(Conversations of this nature would occur every time someone was out of our sight for the rest of the night.
)
'Okay.
Good luck.
'
'Good luck.
'
I hung up, and immediately realized that Rex could have been turned into a chaser, and I'd just told him exactly where we were.
Goddammit.
We dithered a bit figuring how to get from 1 to 2, and decided to head through Goose Island.
This required another dangerous bridge crossing.
From Checkpoint 1 to Checkpoint 2
8:10pm to 8:46pm
In which bells toll (though not for us), we reunite with our own, and are scattered by a chaser who wears his sunglasses at night.
We were tense about the bridge crossing again, but made it across without incident.
Our plan was to take the Goose Island route to Halsted, and then run straight down Halsted until we hit the second checkpoint.
We trotted along the wide, dark industrial lane that ran through Goose Island, surrounded by empty warehouses, worrying that the Bicycle Chaser would zoom onto the street at any minute.
By now it was dark, and there was a chill bite to the air.
The sound of deep bells began to echo through the empty buildings.
They were beautiful and eerie, chiming saturating the brick and stone as we crept down the middle of the street.
We came up out of the darkness onto Halsted, and crossed another small bridge.
A straight line south.
We bunched up, alert, when we saw someone with a red band on the other side of the street ahead, crossing perpendicular to us.
We slowed, and they continued on.
It's unclear whether they just didn't see us or thought we werenâ??t worth the trouble.
We picked up the pace as soon as we passed them, keeping an eye out behind us, and made good time.
We moved fast enough that another group of blues came into sight ahead of us, and we decided to use them for bait.
We slowed down.
They slowed down, having apparently decided the same thing.
Then we realized we knew them.
It was the remnants of the other group of FOEcakes!
Little Monk, Gremlin, and Kevin!
They said they'd lost Sprite and some of the others a while ago, in a close call with a chaser.
More numerous now, we moved swiftly down Halsted.
We were relaxed and happy as we neared the twin mouths of the Grand and Milwaukee Blue Line stop.
Then we noticed a man walking toward us, purpose in his stride.
He had sunglasses on, ones that seemed eerily familiar â?? but no red band!
We slowed, uncertain.
He kept coming.
Something rolled over subconsciously, and we bolted, just as if he were a banded chaser.
(An aside here â?? this just goes to show that it's possible for people to fake their way into just about any role through sheer chutzpah, so long as they're believable enough to get buy-in from those around them.
Take note.
) He ran after us.
Little Monk, Sparrows Fall, and Kevin ended up on the east side of Halsted while the chaser took off after Meredithian, Mr.
G, and Gremlin.
My (Meredithian) experiences up to this point having been sufficiently described by Sparrows Fall, Iâ??ll just pick up where Sparrows left offâ?¦ mostly.
So when the chaser finally came at us, we split up, and Iâ??ll mention what happened then momentarily.
Itâ??s interesting how a group gets to that tipping point.
We walked closer and closer to the chaser, and though I was wary, and even though I had recognized him in fact before he bolted and our group scattered, it still took several seconds for anything to happen.
It did remind me in some way of animals.
Moving as a herd, we began to act somewhat like one we seemed to slow and wait for a sort of critical mass of collective concern to develop before we would run away from anything.
Though we were jumpy, we were also painfully slow to react in many circumstances, which led to a lot of confusion later on.
I was surprised at how easily our group shattered.
I was even more surprising at how I reacted instinctively whenever this happened.
Twice during the night I bolted away from the group and ended up alone.
I was very good at picking a direction to run in which would afford me the most time and strategic possibility for escape, even knowing my actions would separate me from my companions or even leave them to be caught.
When the chaser finally came at us, I turned 180 degrees and ran back north up Halsted.
G was in front of me, and I was grateful I wasnâ??t alone, but I was hanging a bit behind, as I wasnâ??t quite sure I wanted to follow him blindly, either.
I turned quickly west on Ohio and while Mr.
G stuck to the side of the street we were on, I bolted to the north side of the street, where I ducked behind a row of parked cars.
I watched as Gremlin, who I realized had been trailing behind us with the chaser on her heels, made her way in the same direction as Mr.
G, who I could see looking around for me, wondering where I had gone.
I felt a strange desire to hide even from him.
When the chaser came around the corner after Gremlin I considered moving further away, even though he couldnâ??t see me.
I could see a car nearby had just driven into a parking garage, and the door was slowly lowering.
For several seconds I debated whether or not I should dive into the garage to hide out even when it was a few feet from being closed the idea of an Indiana Jones dive and roll seemed like a fantastic idea.
Ultimately, the only thing that kept me in the street was the fear of being trapped inside the garage with no way out.
I could see the chaser lingering on the corner, and I couldnâ??t tell if he could see Gremlin or not, and was just deciding not to go after her.
Gremlin caught up with Mr.
G but I was still uncertain I wanted to reveal my position to anyone.
The chaser went around the other side, and I wasnâ??t sure if he was going to try and sneak up on Gremlin and Mr.
G from another angle, so I held my position and waited to see what would happen.
The chaser came back briefly, and Little Monk, Kevin, and I stayed on our side of the street.
Then he took off again, and we took the opportunity to bolt for the southern entrance to the El (which ran underground here), and the safety zone it provided.
We made it, and immediately began phoning.
But everyone was busy dealing with the chaser, who had switched targets back to them.
Sparrows called me to see what was going on, but uncertain as to what had happened to her and feeling suspicious in general, I didnâ??t say much, and quickly got off the phone, with the excellent excuse of â??Chaser!
â? as I saw Mr.
G and Gremlin bolt away from the same chaser who had obviously came at them from the other side of the building right behind them.
My instincts had proved to be spot on.
While the chaser was otherwise occupied, I ran back exactly the way I came, ending up at the El stop on the tip of the corner of Halsted and Milwaukee.
G called me soon after from the stop across the street and we quickly met up Sparrows Fall, Little Monk, and Kevin had also ended up on the east side of Halsted, but we had become separated from Gremlin.
Everyone made it back into the safe zone but Gremlin.
Little Monk was certain Gremlin had been turned, as she was not answering her phone.
We managed to call her, but Little Monk remained unconvinced that Gremlin hadnâ??t been turned.
While standing in the entrance to the El deciding how to get the few scant blocks to Checkpoint 2, the chaser appeared at the mouth of the El, looming above us, still wearing his sunglasses.
He asked us for one of our red bands, and admitted he had lost his own.
We didn't want to give any of ours up, however, as most of us definitely wanted the ability to hunt people down like dogs should we be caught and turned.
Finally someone realized that his red bandana (currently gracing his head) would serve as a fine chaser band, and he repurposed it accordingly.
We hung out until he left us alone, then cautiously stuck our heads out of the El stop.
No sign of him.
We sprinted across the street, Little Monk leading us through back alleys like a ninja.
We broke into the safe zone without any further incident, and found the tea party â?? as well as Myrna Minx!
Yas was also here!
Since bad luck with a sprained ankle had prevented her from running, she was holding sway over Checkpoint 2, and was kind enough to sign our manifests while giving us the heads up to look for 'Green and yellow' at Checkpoint 3.
Dax rode up on his bicycle then, with cameraperson in tow, and passed on some unsettling information - there were a ludicrous number of chasers ahead of us.
Apparently a bunch of players had just gotten turned and were milling around.
While there, we ran into Rex and Jane, and were happy to see that they'd made it this far.
We also got another call from Gremlin â?? she was minutes away from heading in to Checkpoint 2.
We saw her across the freeway, alone.
While we waited, a debate bloomed.
How to proceed forward to Checkpoint 3?
Most of us didn't want to get near the mass of chasers Dax had warned us about.
However, Rex and Jane were equally vehement about staying away from the El, its limited methods of ingress and egress, and the chaser with sunglasses.
Eventually we decided to split up, with Rex and Jane heading south, and Mr.
G, Meredithian, Sparrows Fall, Gremlin, C, and Kevin heading back toward the El.
We planned to take it in as close as possible to Lower Hubbard, where checkpoint 3 lay waiting.
From Checkpoint 2 to Checkpoint 3
8:46pm to 9:40pm
In which public transportation aids us, someone calls in for our brains location, and the Upper/Lower Wacker demarcation pulls us apart with a little help from our friends in red.
We broke for the El and made it without further incident.
The ride itself was uneventful, but for the continuing debate about how to get out of the El station without getting dogpiled by the chasers we were sure awaited us, as well as whether we should take Michigan or Lower Wacker to get us close to Checkpoint 3.
We spilled out of the El and stopped in the middle of the station to plan in safety.
While there, Kevin's phone rang.
It was Ms.
Goblinpants, who we hadn't seen or heard from since the beginning of the game.
She asked him where we were.
He asked her if she was a chaser.
She mumbled something and hung up.
Throughout the night many people, including me, compared this game to a zombie apocalypse scenario.
And it was very similar - except that if your friends get turned into zombies they don't ring you up and go, 'Soooooâ?¦.
where are your brains right now, exactly?
Do you have the cross-streets for that?
Great, that's great, could you just hang out there for, oh, about another five minutes?
'
We started moving again, and to our joy discovered that the El station faced the street with a bunch of windows.
As one, we pressed ourselves against them, craning our heads up and down the street, looking for chasers.
I'm sure we looked weird as hell.
We didn't see anything, so we moved fast for the street, kept along it until we found Garvey, and turned immediately down into Lower Wacker.
We spread out, with a wary eye towards either side of the underground road.
There were fewer places to run, but we also figured it would be less popular and so less likely to be frequented by the chasers.
I loved that we took the Lower Wacker route, and not just because it was my idea.
It had the perfect ambiance for the Journey, I thought.
Strange underground tunnels, somewhat deserted.
or so it seemed.
We saw someone leaning against a cement support up ahead, and slowed.
G took lead and I took second.
He got close enough to ascertain it was just someone smoking, unmarked â?? they weren't in the game.
We moved forward again.
The path forked, one left, one right, and we headed right.
Two people were walking in our direction, at about the same pace as we.
We slowed down again.
Kevin and I took lead.
One of the people was carrying a water bottle â?? that probably meant they were in-game.
They were eerily expressionless â?? none of the waves or grins we had exchanged with other groups of blues we had encountered were in evidence here.
Then one turned slightly, and the bright white light of the underground caught at the band on their upper arm â?? crimson.
'RED, RED, RUN!
'
We bolted back and took the other side of the fork.
After a bit it became clear they hadn't followed us, and we slowed down.
We came to the bridge that crossed the river.
Just on the other side lay Checkpoint 3.
There was a miscommunication, and suddenly Little Monk, Gremlin, Meredithian, and I were on the upper part of the bridge, while Mr.
G and Kevin were beneath it.
Meredithian got on the phone with Mr.
G, but he said something about chasers and hung up fast.
It sounded like they were penned in â?? that maybe they had been caught.
Not having Kevin's number, we could only guess that the same had happened to him.
To be fair, Mr.
G called me and I was extremely wary (as I had been with everyone throughout the race) that he had been turned and was calling me for the sole purpose of entrapment!
I was very vague and hedged a lot on the phone, even when he assured me he and Kevin were safe and asked where I was at, to guide us into the checkpoint, I revealed nothing.
I hung up on him abruptly, citing possible danger, even when there was none - we were just about to reach the checkpoint.
I was amazed at my ability to write off people I had been bonded to moments before.
Once out of sight, they were near dead to me, and I would take no chances.
Wary, we drifted into the Michigan Avenue crowds, trying to look at everyone's upper arms.
We found the stairs down to lower Hubbard, warily approached, then bolted for it.
We reached the bar, and found Kevin and Mr.
False alarm, it turns out, and both were okay.
We went in, and Terpsichore was kind enough to sign our manifest.
While there, we discovered that Rex and Jane - they had also made it through!
We were happily reunited.
We had made it alive halfway through the game, with only Ms.
Goblinpants down, as far as we knew.
From Checkpoint 3 to Checkpoint 4
9:40pm to 10:13pm
In which one of our own seeks out socks, Michigan Avenue is remarkably safe, we make a dumb mistake regarding block location, and our numbers grow.
We got moving again, all of us heading up to Michigan, determined to take it south into the city, since it had served us so well last time.
Then suddenly Jane slowed â?? she needed to buy socks.
Our group strung out, indecisive.
Some stayed with Jane to keep her company.
G, Meredithian, and I were on point and didn't realize people had gone back until they were already out of sight.
We decided to continue on.
We headed back down Michigan the way we had come, trying to blend into a huge crowd of about fifteen rowdy people in the hopes that chasers would mistake us for people who weren't in-game.
While tense, things were still uneventful.
We spotted a pack of blues ahead of us, and tracked slowly behind them.
When we glanced back we saw Kevin, walking confidently down the street in our direction.
He told us what had happened with the socks, and said that everyone else was on their way in a few blocks behind us.
Again, when Gremlin called and asked where we were, and I hedged.
I couldn't outright lie, because I felt guilty, but the location tags I gave were at least five minutes behind where we were actually at.
I was starting to be concerned about the level of my mistrust.
We kept pace behind the blues until we made it to the safe zone â?? or rather, what we thought was the safe zone.
We'd gotten turned around somehow, and thought it was one block north of its actual position.
Luckily there weren't any chasers in the area, or we would have trotted right up to them like lambs.
We spotted the box tower that looked like it was Checkpoint 4 (what else could a giant tower of boxes be on this night?
), and at first thought the police had made them move down a block.
We headed for the tower, and were happy to see that Sprite had clearly made it at least this far, as he'd signed his name on the tower.
We signed our names as well, stamped our manifests, picked up the next clue ('Two girls, one dress') and waited until the rest of our people caught up.
While there, we were approached by two other players â?? Ninja and her friend had lost their group early on, and were traveling alone, wondering if they could join up with us.
We were happy to have them.
About the same time we settled that we'd all be traveling together, the others showed up and told us the bad news â?? Jane had decided to stop while she was ahead, before her sore feet took her out of the game.
We were sorry we didn't get to say goodbye.
Once everyone got their manifests stamped, the nine of us headed out (Mr.
G, Meredithian, Sparrows Fall, Gremlin, Little Monk, Kevin, Rex, Ninja, Ninja's friend).
Kevin used to work downtown, and knew several back streets he said would keep us out of harm's way.
From Checkpoint 4 to Checkpoint 5
10:13pm to 11:02pm
In which everything goes to hell.
This is where everything went to hell.
Things started out tense.
Moments after we had emerged from the safe zone, we spotted the telltale red armband of a chaser on someone across the street from us.
Luckily they were traveling in the opposite direction, and traffic was heavy.
We kept a wary eye behind us, in case they crossed and came after us, and decided to switch our armbands en masse to the side of us not facing the road.
We also strung out a bit, clustering into groups of two or three, so that we didn't look like a giant glaring pack of people.
We could have been any group of tense, jumpy Chicagoans out for a stroll that night.
At that point I was starving, and Gremlin saved me by offering me a candy bar, which I ended up splitting with Mr.
Heartened, I paused briefly to take a picture of the city as we crossed the bridge that would bring us on to canal.
You got a candy bar!
=D

It was at this point that Dax wheeled up to us, still with cameraperson, and smiled.
He stuck beside us as we trotted south on Canal, long enough to tell us that at least fifty chasers were hanging out on the road ahead of us.
Thankful for the warning but not for its content, we grimly pushed forward.
The problem with Checkpoint 5 was that since it was on a bridge there were only two possible entrances.
That made it easy to block, and easy for chasers to stalk people coming in, since the paths of approach were severely limited.
We continued down Canal, spread out, paranoid, and jumpy.
We came to a street corner, and a guy stepped into view across the street from us, talking on his cellphone.
We could see one arm, but not the cell arm.
We stopped on our corner.
The light changed so he could cross to the corner furthest away from us.
He did not move.
We did not move.
That went on for a bit.
He finally started walking away from us.
We started crossing, and got at the right angle to spot the telltale red band on his cellphone arm.
He kept going, and we trotted warily across.
We came to an access road leading down, which looked good, except it was private property, and possibly a dead end.
Should we risk being trapped or take the obvious route?
We slowed, discussing.
And the fucking chaser whipped around and ran back across the street at us.
(This picture looks horrible on my display.
I think that is because it is TREMENDOUS IN SIZE.
If you head down to the proof list at the end and open it in another window, you will see it in its true grandeur.
)

We scattered, Meredithian and Kevin heading north up canal, the other seven of us down the access road.
The chaser picked meredithian and Kevin.
I hung back, crouched behind the wall of the access road, and watched as kevin's sprint carried him away from the chaser, who slowed to a jog.
He was still only about ten feet away.
I turned and sprinted back down the access road, to where Ninja and her friend waited.
'He's off Kevin and might come back this way, go, go!
'
It turned out, in fact, he'd taken off after Meredithian, but we didn't know that at the time.
Thinking the access road to the parking garage was sure to be a dead end leading to chaserhood, I ran in the opposite direction of everyone else.
I couldn't help but feel that my plan was not only more sound, but also that the easy pickings in the parking garage would be sought after first, and that I was safe.
Here my instincts for self-preservation failed me I couldn't have been more wrong.
I saw the chaser follow not the seemingly trapped herd, but rather Kevin, who was surprisingly fast.
I had already bolted half the block, and thought he had gone for Kevin, and so had slowed down near a doorway.
But when I looked up, I saw had given up on Kevin, and seen me stop.
He must have thought I was weak, or slow, or something else prey-like, because suddenly he was locked onto me and coming up fast.
I took off, and ran another block before looking over my shoulder only to see that he was still with me!
He was no closer, but he hadn't given up.
I ran on, only looking ahead.
After passing another street I took the chance of looking over my shoulder again, and thought I could still see a black clad figure about the same distance away!
We kept running, neither gaining, neither slowing.
I no longer looked back.
When I saw what I thought was an alley, I cut in, thinking this could be my chance to get away, only to find it was a dead end.
Panting, seconds ticking by, I debated my options.
Here I was trapped.
I could either wait for the inevitable, or try to break for it.
I wasn't going to give up without a fight, so quickly I decided I might still have a close second or two to bolt out of the alley and make another break.
I jogged to the corner, and with a quick glance that revealed nothing, I shot off, back onto Canal, but.
the chaser was nowhere in sight.
Hadn't he been right with me, only maybe 50-100 feet behind?
Where could he have gotten to so fast, if he had only just given up?
Was it someone else in black I had seen in my furtive over the shoulder glimpses?
It didn't matter.
He could be hiding nearby, lying in wait.
I jogged skittishly across the street, trying to see if he was behind some cars - a tactic I had used earlier.
I couldn't see him anywhere.
He was, inexplicably and suddenly, gone.
This did not relieve my tension at all.
I was now over four blocks away, in an area apparently riddled with chasers, and with no idea what had happened to anyone else.
All alone.
I was in a parking lot of sorts, skulking around cars, probably looking very suspicious.
I couldn't decide if I should go back the same way, and run the risk of following the chaser who I had just lost, or try to try and find out what had happened to other people.
After being part of a group all night, even when I felt fettered by our need for group decisions, I found myself not wanting to be solely responsible for myself.
I didn't know what to do.
I was about to walk over to the nearest large intersection, Canal and.
something, just to see how far away I was, and come up with a plan.
The very idea seemed distasteful.
Then I saw what I thought would be my salvation - there seemed to be some kind of street, or something, running under Canal.
Was there a Lower Canal like there was a Lower Wacker?
I was going to have to climb over a very high and pointy fence to find out but, well, that just seemed like more fun.
My enthusiasm renewed, I bounded onto a guardrail and leapt over the 6'-8' wrought iron fence and then slid down a gravel embankment into an underground passage.
It was a very long parking garage, with no end in sight.
Meanwhile, the rest of us (sans Kevin) ran down the access road beside the train/El tracks, then slowed to a walk, and a few minutes later were into a big parking garage.
I called Meredithian, who it turned out had sprinted about 8 blocks away and lost the chaser, but didn't know where she was and needed time to re-orient.
We got off the phone.
So here the seven of us were, stuck in a parking garage.
We were pretty sure the chaser was heading back to the entrance we'd used to get in, which left only two ways out â?? a set of metal stairs up through the center of the garage, and the driveway entrance for cars.
We headed for the stairs.
G took a step or two up them, peering up.
He backed down, and motioned us back.
We were in a diffuse group through the structure, keeping as much space between us as possible.
We headed for the entrance driveway.
Little Monk and I took point, me on right, she on left.
I got just far enough out to see a group of five chasers right on top of the entrance outside.
I scooted backward the same time Little Monk did LM â?? were those the guys you saw, or did you see someone else, too?
They had been talking.
There was a good chance they didn't see us.
Little Monk and I motioned everyone else back vigorously, and we all moved back into the garage at a trot.
G was just ahead of me.
This gave me a great view when he glanced casually back, his eyes widened and he screamed, 'CHASER, CHASER!
'
And pointed directly the fuck behind me.
I swung around, and a woman with a red band was about twelve feet back and in the middle of us, coming at a sprint, like demon out of nowhere.
We all sprinted.
I tracked Mr.
G, who took a flying leap over a low cement wall.
I was right on his heels.
We ran across the gravel and into a parking lot, and turned around to see a chaser on an upper level of the garage (who we would have seen close-up, had we taken the stairs), but not our chaser.
(It turns out that ninja and her friend had sprinted back out of the garage the way we came, and our chaser followed them, not the rest of us.
I wasn't in a head count mode, though, as we were still in immediate danger.
Guys, what happened to you?
Dax said you got caught in the produce section of Whole Foods?
)
The parking lot was completely encircled with a chain link fence.
We were cornered.
Then it became clear there was an entrance at one end, and we headed for it.
It came out right at the edge of the safe zone for Checkpoint 5.
Which was crawling with chasers.
We reached the exit of the parking lot and a group of chasers ran toward us.
We sprinted out of the confines of the garage, across the street, through a parking lot, toward a grocery store, then around the backside of a bank.
(Somewhere in all that mess I'm pretty sure one of the chasers was star5, but we're not sure what bit was hers, exactly.
)
And suddenly we were down to four.
Rex, myself, Gremlin, and Little Monk were all that remained.
Somehow we'd lost Mr.
G, but we didn't know when.
We sat panting and out of sight behind the bank.
I called Mr.
G, but he didn't answer.
I called Meredithian.
She had found a vast underground garage and was making her way south.
We hadn't seen Kevin since the original run at the beginning of the access road, and I didn't have his number.
Didn't have Ninja and her friend's number, either.
There were four of us, down from nine.
And between us and the safe zone was a pack of at least six chasers.
At this point, Mr.
G called me and said he was already at Checkpoint 5, but thought that everyone else caught.
My heart sank.
Sparrows Fall!
I felt a bit more emboldened, though, thinking that even if alone, I was still in the game, when others had seemingly faltered.
G offered to explain to me how he had found a tricky way out of the parking garage, but I told him that I was too far away for his intel to be of any use, and that I had my own plan, and would meet him soon.
The parking garage was far more eerie than either Goose Island or Lower Wacker had been.
The atmosphere thrilled me, and I jogged along at a clip.
There was no way I would meet a chaser down here.
It was my secret to success.
However, nearing the spot right about where I thought we had split up originally (at about Taylor) I could see something tragic - a fence, from the floor to the ceiling, signalling the end of my path.
I came closer and stopped, stared.
there was about a foot or foot and a half gap between the top of a 20' or so chain link fence.
I could climb it and maybe sneak through, but the other side, when would that end?
I couldn't see what was over there.
No more parked cars, and within a few feet, no more lights.
possibly a huge wall that I couldn't see.
right before I climbed up anyway, partly to see just if I could, and how far I could get (I had after all brought a flashlight) I noticed that the halogen lights on the fence weren't really attached to anything else.
There was no warning sign but, was this fence.
electrified?
I seriously doubted it, but I couldn't be sure.
Heeding Dax's earlier words (and not knowing of any positive test on how to find out if a fence was electrified without actually touching it - why hadn't I researched that online?
) I decided not to risk it.
But this meant I would have to go back.
On my backtrack I tried not to feel dejected.
After all, I had seen no other exits.
Maybe the way I came in was the only way in and even if I had made it under the safe zone, I would have had to go back anyway.
We sat for a while, then decided to break so that there were two of us on either side of the street and just sprint for it.
Run right into the midst of them, kamikaze, and if we couldn't get through, at least die gloriously.
Little Monk checked one side of the building and it was clear.
I checked the other.
And miraculously, the chasers had disappeared from the mouth of the safe zone.
And then some blue appared from further west and ran east down Roosevelt toward the safe zone alone.
We sprinted, following the fellow blue in, in case the reds were all in hiding somewhere.
And we made it.
Waiting for us were Mr.
G and Kevin.
With blue ribbons intact!
They had made it!
I called Meredithian.
Her underground parking garage scheme had backfired â?? dead end.
She had to backtrack.
We got our manifest signed by 'Two girls one dress'.
I didn't recognize InkTea (who I'd met at brunch), because she was in makeup and I was on the phone and adrenaline scattered and probably just not that attentive a person to begin with, unfortunately.
I finally apologized and got out of the restaurant, since I was incapable of lucid human interaction just then.
I tried to get Meredithian to tell me where she was.
She wouldn't, suspicious that I had been chasered and would lead her into a trap.
I said I'd call back.
The rest of us regrouped and agreed to wait in case Meredithian was able to make her way in safely.
Back above ground and once more four blocks away, I got a call from Sparrows Fall.
Everyone had made it to the safe zone, except me.
They had been trying to call me.
I was far away, alone, and had wasted maybe twenty minutes or more on my underground adventure.
You sounded so sad on the phone.
I was feeling close to the end of my rope.
I imagined no way in.
Sparrows said Checkpoint 5 was crawling with chasers, many who had been recently turned and were taking a break, or hoping to catch a runner and hurry to the end.
From the beginning of the race I was convinced I might not make it past even the first checkpoint, convinced the chasers would cover all bridges and choke points and there would be nearly no way through, without some sacrifice.
I tried to tell myself that if I made it past Checkpoint 3, I would feel some sense of accomplishment.
But to get this far, and all my friends to have made it except me.
I could only blame myself.
This is where my actions had led me.
When I could have stuck with the group I abandoned them.
If now I was alone, and going to get caught alone, that could only be because of me.
Meredithian, I had no idea you were having a dark tea-time of the soul!
However, depsite all that, I was once again suspicious that Sparrows herself hadn't been caught and turned, and was trying to suss me out.
I hedged and flailed.
Finally, at Harrison and Clinton, I told her my plan was to get on the Green line, which I was sure had a Clinton stop somewhere nearby.
Sparrows told me not to do that!
Not only because the Green line was much farther north than I thought (and indeed, the stop on my map that I made it to was only the Blue line Clinton stop, which did not go to Roosevelt) but because the Roosevelt stop was actually two blocks or more east of the safe zone.
I eventually chose to believe her, after talking with her for many minutes.
She couldn't be wasting this much time as a chaser just for me.
But it still felt hopeless.
She was directing me to come back east on Clinton, or maybe Jefferson, all the way to Roosevelt, and then come north from there.
It didn't seem like it would work, but it was the only plan I had.
Tired and alone and a 15 minute walk away, I took her advice as my only option.
I phoned her again, and she was coming in one block away, on Clinton.
We decided to be her eyes, standing on the street corner and looking for reds.
A pack of reds came by and stood on the corner outside the safe zone, catcalling, encouraging us to cross, their sirens to our Odysseus.
After a while they just crossed and went into the diner for some water.
There was another group of chasers hiding about thirty feet to the north, near Staples, but they weren't looking south and couldn't see much of Roosevelt, so if Meredithian came in at a run she would make it.
Sparrows talked to me the entire way in.
The conversation varied from boring to frustrated ('Here's where I am.
Is it clear?
' 'I CAN'T see you - I DON'T know!
') but as I got closer, I felt this just might work.
After all, I was so late, maybe most of the chasers had gone.
This proved to be true, as when I finally got within sight of my crew, there were no obstacles between me and the 5th checkpoint.
Upon reaching Checkpoint 5, I was overcome with gratitude and more than a little chagrin.
The entire night I had been willing to abandon my teammates and write them off as soon as we were endangered.
But everyone - even Mr.
G who wanted not only to finish, but to finish fast - had waited for me, for over 30 minutes, to arrive.
It had taken us an hour overall to get from Checkpoint 4 to Checkpoint 5, and most of that time was due to me.
We kept an eye out, and when the moment was right Meredithian came sprinting in from Roosevelt and made her way into the safe zone.
We were once again a single unit.
Meredithian went in a got her manifest signed, while Kevin screwed with the chasers.
So, yeah, you two chasers from the Staples group who were coming south toward Roosevelt when you heard a blue scream, 'Run, they're coming!
' And motion wildly?
And then you slowed down and went into stealth mode and started creeping around the building?
There was totally no one there.
After having my manifest signed, and taking a much needed bathroom break, I was on the road, with my friends, and determined and certain, for the first time, to get all the way to the end.
Meredithian returned, and we set out through the safe zone toward Checkpoint 6, and the end of the game.
Like a doomful harbinger, Dax and his cameraperson materialized out of the night to accompany us, with news that most of the chasers had gathered between Checkpoints 5 and 6 to stop the surviving runners from finishing the game.
They would lie throughout Grant park, obscured in the green darkness, waiting.
From Checkpoint 5 to the Finish
11:02pm to 12:08am
In which we almost split up but then stay together, are jumpy like bunnies, and attempt the green belt crossing to freedom.
Between us and the finish line, a supposed army of chasers.
Beside us, Dax, friendly and full of information but also standing out like a signal flare to any nearby chasers.
Within us, doubt.
How could we get to the Shedd Aquarium?
It was possible to take the direct route, but it was likely infested with reds.
Many of us wanted to go north.
But some had people not in-game who were depending on them being at certain places by certain times that night, and the game had already had hold of them for far too long.
Also, some of us were just impatient.
)
We argued about where to go as we walked, Dax wheeling beside and ahead of us the whole time.
Our group almost split in two, with three taking the direct route and the remaining four taking an indirect, northbound way.
But the three decided we were going to do this together, or not at all, and reversed, heading north as well, until all seven of us were reunited (still accompianed by the companiable Dax).
So we continued, Mr.
G, Meredithian, Sparrows Fall, Little Monk, Gremlin, Kevin, and Rex.
Kevin came up with a good martyr's plan â?? if we got bogged down in chasers and one of us was tagged, the tagged person was to grab the chaser in a huge bear hug.
By the time the chaser managed to peel their ill-gotten gains off of them and get the blue ribbon, the rest of us would be long gone.
Little Monk, who had been trailing the group, chose that moment to run up to us screaming, and we all freaked.
This is her just afterward, looking appriately nefarious:

We headed north, then east again, hoping to avoid the majority of the chasers we suspected were gathering around the El stop just to the east of the Roosevelt safe zone (and from reading other people's praxii, it looks like that was a good choiceâ?¦).
We darted south into a park, argued about the proper direction, then headed north again.
While we were busy with that, Dax headed on without us.
We were crossing a street when we saw someone who looked suspiciously in-game (dressed in hardy clothing, water bottle, the intent look) coming up behind us.
The suddenly we were running â?? they were after us!
Two blocks away we found out from those of us in the rear that it had been a blue, charging at us to freak us out.
Which ended up handy, because it sped us up enough to ease a little of the time pressure that some folks were dealing with.
One last bridge crossing, into Grant park, lay before us.
Beyond that, Lakeshore Drive, the last obstacle before the Checkpoint 6 safe zone.
We crept forward.
G took lead.
Only the night and the trees were there to greet us.
We heard yelling to the south, but saw nothing, and continued on.
I tried to convince people we should just charge across Lakeshore Drive, but was overruled.
We were approaching the intersection when the pedestrian crossing began to flash red.
We sprinted.
And like that, we were safe - after chasers and separations and reunions, through a game that we later learned had taken two-thirds of the runners that began it.
We made it, and we made it together.
We walked in, jubilant.
I paused to take a picture of the city, and then a snapshot of the party when we found it.
(I know it's blurred - I was using my knee to brace the camera, and my legs were shaking.
)
After that, Dax gave out medals to people with the best story of their night, in ten words or less!
Oliver X, who had used children to scout for chasers, won:

As did the Sean Mahan and Lara Black, who manned Checkpoint 1 (I got a picture of you guys after all!
) for talking to a police officer about whether they were re-opening the restaurant Checkpoint 1 was positioned in front of:

And Little Monk, for her story about faking her way past the Bicycle Chaser by pretending she was just someone trying to get into her apartment:

And in a perfect conclusion to the night, we also found some cupcakes that had not yet been eaten - being foes of cakes, this was the perfect opportunity to crush those tiny villains.
Picture of said event is in Little Monk's praxis.
Fittingly, on the way out we saw a red ribbon laying abandoned on the ground:

To Dax, and all of the wonderful volunteers who made Journey to the End of the Night: ChicagÃ? work, thank you.
This was a fantastic voyage, and one we will remember for a long time.
You turned us from plainclothes Chicagoans into metronauts, and set us loose upon the city.
I will end with some of the physical remains of the night.
One red ribbon, unused:

One blue ribbon, well-used:

A somewhat battered map for Checkpoints 1 and 2:

A very battered map for Checkpoints 3-6:

Sparrows' manifest:

Meredithian's manifest:

Addendum
It's interesting looking at the different dynamics of games that tend to echo war.
Paintball, football, chess, Journey to the End of the Night.
Two teams, a distinct playing field (whether a city or a checkered board), strategies and fallen.
We had to deal with communications compromised by the enemy (as people once our friends turned chaser and tried to get us to reveal our location).
There were sudden encounters, ambushes, people approaching who could be friends, enemies, or innocent bystanders.
Encounters were not scheduled â?? they happened suddenly, and sometimes you were not certain whether they had happened at all, or if you were jumping at ghosts in the night (or some guy out walking his dog).
Periods of long, tense waiting were followed by explosive moments of running and adrenaline.
We planned in an environment of high uncertainty, and watched those plans dissolve in seconds, watched miscommunications open people to risk, watched choices we could very easily have made ourselves end in catastrophe.
I like this game better than most of the others, if only because the people who are taken aren't left to stand at the sidelines, or removed from the board entirely.
They merely put on a different color, start playing by different rules, phone you up and see if they can get you to tell them where you are.
They stand across the street and tease and jeer, and wave you over to them with open arms.
Racing across the city was such fun --  we picked up Jenny along the way, ran into Ian's lovely parents (and many other players) on the 38 Geary bus, got tagged by Mac on his bicycle and a big gang (incl.
Eris and Mella) in GG Park.
Loved the bonfire at the end at Ocean Beach.
twas a chill end to the task and a great way to meet other players over smores and drink.
Notes from a chaser in a gorilla suit
Chicago looks at you a little differently when you're wearing a gorilla suit -- even if you're not wearing the head.
Â I wish I could've worn the head, but the obstructed view would have handicapped my already speed-limited chaser abilities.
Â Also, it smelled bad.
The positive responses far outweighed the negative ones.
Â I think people like being chased by a gorilla.
Â It's like being chased by a friendly dog with no fear of biting or rabies (I hope.
)
Sure, those three kids I chased who weren't playing might have been a bit confused, and the policeman who stopped me seemed upset I wasn't wearing the mask, but all in all I'd say my first experience as a staff chaser was a success.
Thanks Dax for another fabulous Journey.
I assisted the amazing Dax (wow, that sounds like a stage magic act, doesn't it?
) in whatever ways I was able for his superb planning of Journey to the End of the Night: Chicago.
On the evening of April 11th, about a week before the event, we met up and walked the 7.
5 mile route so that I could preview what the players would see on the 19th, and so Dax could troubleshoot the map he'd created for the players to use.
The first five photos below were taken on that walk, at about the same time of night the players would be encountering the same sights during the game.
We took the shortest distances possible between checkpoints and did not use the train.
I'm really glad we had the chance to do this, since I was the agent for the final checkpoint, would have to drive all the equipment directly from the starting line to the finish line when the game actually began, and would otherwise not have gotten to see the route at all.
A small crowd of about ten people had gathered at the starting location around the fountain in Wicker Park when I arrived around 6:15pm.
We set up small tables for the registration forms and to display the awards, and cut the lengths of blue and red ribbon that would be used as armbands to designate runners and chasers.
I took up the duty of making sure everyone got signed in, took one blue and one red ribbon, and received a route map/checkpoint manifesto.
Dax made the opening announcements, including the reading of the rules, around 7:15 - at this point, there were about 150 runners ready to begin their Journey.
In the middle of his instructions, his cellphone rang, much to the amusement of the crowd.
It was the staff chasers calling in from their starting positions in the field, checking in with Dax and reminding the runners that there was actually something to be running from once the game started.
At 7:30, Dax's bullhorn rang out with an 'ON YOUR MARKS!
' and a whistle blew - the 150 gathered runners immediately dispersed in literally all directions from the central point of the fountain.
This was an incredible sight, really, one of my very favorite moments.
I hopped in my car and delivered some extra supplies to the ladies at checkpoint 2, then made my way down to the lakefront to set up the finish line.
On my way there, I got a text message - the first runners had passed through checkpoint 1, at about 8:15.
I also learned that my fantastic checkpoint 6 partner, Daniel, had gotten a flat bike tire on his way to meet me and was diverting to the train.
Because I wouldn't have any help unloading the car and wouldn't be able to unload, watch the supplies, and park my car all at the same time, I called Dax and we reached the decision to move the finish line to Solidarity Drive, the street that ran behind the original Field Museum checkpoint and alongside of the Shedd Aquarium.
I was able to secure parking, and I tied the CG0 flagpole to the side mirror of my car, so approaching runners would see it.
I set up tables full of cupcakes for the inevitable arrival of hungry players, and began to wait.
Daniel arrived with his injured bicycle just before the first chaser to finish trotted up to us at about 8:20.
It was d - clare!
Four more chasers arrived before our first runner - Matt Larrain with his manifest signatures completed - ran up and threw himself on the ground in exhaustion at 9:00.
After that, there was a series of chasers - all with 'kills' - who came in to share stories and have some delicious sugar- and carb-filled snacks.
Our champion chaser, Whit, with an incredible thirteen captures, arrived around 10:30.
We gave medals to the first 12 chasers to arrive with at least one capture, and to the 45 runners that returned their completed manifestos (I have 13 of those medals to make and send out this week - I promise I won't forget!
Everyone had wonderful, exciting tales of evasion and strategy - it was so much fun to be there as people came in and added their chapters to the evolving story of the Journey.
Dax arrived around midnight and awarded the trophies to Matt and our most prolific chaser, and medals to the players with the best stories from the field - LittleMonk, lara black, and OliverX.
The party broke up shortly after the ceremonies due to lateness of the hour (it was about 1:30am), weariness of the players, intervention of the authorities (although it was very mild and the delightful Ms.
Minx did an outstanding job of placating them), and the promise of an afterparty by Gremlin (happy birthday!
Thank you, Dax, for giving our city this epic event!
I can't wait to read everyone's stories!
I'd heard of previous Journeys but at the time they didn't compel me.
Now it's maybe a different era in my life.
I feel like I've done enough standing-around-and-drinking for a lifetime the opportunity to do anything else is a treasure.
My bike exploded on the way to Embarcadero, so we got to the signup late.
They said they'd given out six hundred waivers and that was it.
I'd been looking forward to this all month, so I took a long moment to hold my head in my hands in shock wondering if I could work off any of the disappointment by going home to play Borderlands.
After all the legit Runners had left, they kept giving ribbons to anyone who wanted them, but not manifests.
We ribboned up, and a short distance into the route my companion finagled a manifest from another Runner.
Thusly my night un-ruined itself.
The road to One, particularly Second street, was paved with Chasers on the sidelines, likely just to freak people out.
As far as game-theory goes, it's probably a bad idea for too many to get tagged early on, because any ruthless player-Chasers you create might tear apart the big crowds or start camping at later checkpoints too early.
Course, every player could turn whenever they want, so I don't know how much control Staff have over this.
We didn't see a single chaser on the route from One to Two, the stortest hop of the night.
Things fell apart after Two - Chasers caught us in a long alleyway and we bolted different directions.
On my own, I was disoriented and didn't keep good watch.
Got spotted by some Chasers while crossing the street (six of them one of me), and despite some deft maneuvers around cars that were waiting at Fourth and Howard, I was handily outran.
As a consolation, my purser gifted me Skittles.
Since we only had one manifest between us I met back up with my companion and handed it over as a neutral party before adopting my orange ribbon.
He got tagged coming back from Three.
We made it to Four and Five as Chasers, enjoying the moment and looking for targets of opportunity.
Five in particular seemed like it would be pretty easy to lock down by four to eight pairs of ruthless Chasers, but that wouldn't be any fun.
Some contact ensued, but my legs were no good anymore.
Heck, they're still sore a day after.
Lurking back to the Mission from Five we had basically stopped playing, which unfortunately missed us an amazing target of opportunity.
A pack of Runners were lingering nonchalantly at Market and Valencia, while we waited on the traffic island for the same signal.
I hadn't realized any Runners might be ascending from Hipster Valencia, as we'd basically taken Market all the way into Hayes.
There was a fun moment when we noted each others colors and they took off with a quickness, crossing Market at Octavia before I could close any distance with them.
This might be what it's like to be in a street gang.
I'd like to comment on is how dangerous this thing can get around busy streets.
When being chased, the wrong kind of self-preservation instinct comes in and makes you want to leap out into the street - I did it, and I forced others to do it.
I think we were all pretty aware, but I'm glad I didn't do any drinking before or during play.
At the same time, I think the presence of danger, literal and imagined, is what makes this game what it is, and made this one of the most memorable experiences of my life.
If you asked me to recall some salient details about the previous day at work the notes I could give would be fuzzy, but I have memories burned into me of each chase that will stick for a while.
my best night in la so far!
I knew I wasn't very athletic, and couldn't outrun those art school kids, so I thought ahead and brought bribes: fancy chocolate.
Packed my bag full of it, along with bottled water, and set out for the starting point.
Upon receiving the map, I called the DC phone number immediately, figuring once the game was in play I'd get a busy signal.
Sure enough, someone answered and gave me the address.
A few more times over the night, I simply called to see if anyone needed the box number, and every time someone answered.
guess I needn't have worried about the crowd.
I asked all the DC players where they were, geographically, and everyone seemed to be confused by the question - one did say they were on Mass Ave, but no neighborhood, cross-street, nothing.
I'm really curious where they were!
We booked it north off Columbus and Jackson to Adams, catching the #4 bus in our group of five with no difficulty, taking it to 11th and Michigan and the first checkpoint easily.
We crossed Michigan and went through the lobby of my building with my electronic passkey out to the alley behind, crossed through the Sam's parking lot, and easily made it to the Roosevelt CTA station, where we met up with a Chaser on a bike with a flat.
We kindly pointed him in the direction of a free bike pump, and, having dispatched him, crossed over State to the bridge, where we reached the second checkpoint easily.
We cut through the Whole Foods and the mall to use the washroom (men's was closed, we ladies stood watch while the guys peed).
Out on the side, we went along the balcony to Taylor and cut across north to Halsted by UIC, eluding chasers.
We ran into plenty of players on the bus, who let us know that the bonus checkpoint could sign off on the third AND another checkpoint.
so we made the call to go to the bonus.
That was our mistake.
We got off on 16th street, and zigzagged through alleys, eventually scattering when someone spotted another person and assumed it was a chaser.
We all ended up popping up side alleys along 19th street near the bonus checkpoint, but there was a PHALANX of young, spry, aggressive chasers lining the street, and all of us but one were caught immediately.
It was actually kind of lame - some younger ladies tagged my friend and kept running to catch others, but when they came to collect her blue armband, they weren't wearing red ones, saying they'd \run out.'
There really should have been a safe zone around the bonus checkpoint.
Once it stops being fun, we weren't interested.
we're just not aggressive people, so whatever.
I was tempted to just \catch\' one blue player
but decided that was too close to cheating even though I would have turned down the award at the end.
One of our merry band of players is black, and he was the only one who got away from the chasers in Pilsen - running full speed through alleys, jumping over trashcans while being chased by some young punk.
He finally realized what a tactical \real world\' mistake that was.'
a young black guy running as fast as he could, being pursued by someone, wearing armbands, through the alleys of a neighborhood he didn't know.
So instead of risking bodily harm by non-player neighbors, he took off his blue, dropped it, and put on the red to walk back and meet the rest of us by the bonus checkpoint.
I gave everyone there some chocolate, hung out for a bit, and took the Halsted bus to the orange line and headed home.
All in all, I really enjoyed the orienteering part of this game, and the scavenger-hunt aspect, but the running and aggression of chasers, not so much.
I would rather have had the opportunity to go through the course and not worried about running from kids much more spry than I.
I already put a description up in the comments area.
As proof I still have my manifest, green armband and the flower i recieved at the end.
I participated in the Journey to the End of the Street last night.
It was great!
There were several hundred people playing and most were wearing costumes.
My favorite costumes of the night were the Yup Yup aliens (from Sesame Street) and the Coconut drink with the green umbrella.
I was also digging on the Gold Lady's costume.
My partner, Shannon, and I made it to the first (out of 7) checkpoints by walking.
I gave a handsome SFPD officer a high five.
We saw a couple chasers, but they didn't seem to be doing much chasing at that point.
I think they were just trying to scare us.
The chasers became more active on the way to the second checkpoint, and we had to run several times.
Neither Shannon nor I are very strong runners, so we had to rely mostly on our cunning and wits.
:)  That didn't work for too long, because Shannon got caught by a chaser.
I couldn't let Shannon be a chaser by herself, so I stood there and let someone tag me.
That's when the game got really fun.
Chasing was way more fun than running!
I was a maniac, going after every yellow band I saw.
I tagged big, strong guys and some thin girls.
I had no mercy.
If they were wearing a yellow band, they were going down!
I had the pleasure of tagging this arrogant guy I heard talking earlier that night.
\I'm just going to run because I'm fast and the chasers won't be able to catch me.'
The best reaction was when I tagged an unsuspecting runner who was talking on his cell phone at a corner.
His reaction was golden.
He yelled, \Oh
Later, Shannon and I took a bus over to the 5th checkpoint to get our tag on.
By the time we got there, we were so exhausted that I just decided to take BART home.
I had to write some essays for school the next day (which I am successfully procrastinating as I'm writing this.
)
Overall, it was a great night, and I can't wait until the next one.
Maybe I'll even take some pictures next time!
My Saturday job was on the periphery officially, my title was \SMORE QUEEN.'
I showed up at the Ferry building just as all the other players did, but since I had already been dubbed graham cracker royalty, I could only witness the the buzzing buzzing buzzing with no option of release until the deferred fire.
At 7:45 the runners took off in a fury, and the few of us left watched, awestruck, giddy in their wake.
They were to fight a good fight.
I spent a good portion of the night riding shotty in the car with a skittish Sam, being a telephone proxy, relaying Very Important Information.
And also making sure enough Flin Flon was playing on his space-age stereo.
We got to the beach around 9 and felt around for a perfect bonfire place.
Sam was excited and excitable.
Sean arrived next, and the fire building began.
Via telephone, we heard of the race and all its rough and smooth spots from at least ten different voices.
I sat on the sand as Sean poked at the fire and imagined all moments of the race happening simultaneously, non-linear-like, truly polyphonous.
In my head, it looked beautiful.
The three traveling hippies arrived at that point, sat by the fire, talked New Jersey with Sean, offered us wine then weed then ganja gooey balls and then eventually left.
The chasers trickled in, then the triumphant winning players.
I was ready with chocolate in one pocket, graham crackers in the other, and a fistful of marshmallows.
I greeted the winners with the first s'mores of the night.
For the next long while, I made good on my title, braving the heat of the fire to roast marshallows three by three, every few minutes shouting, \I've got a s'more
I was happy to feed such courageous racers.
The dedicated SF0 players impressed me, to say the least, and I was glad that I could contribute to the culminating happy end.
And to top it all off, by midnight the fun of the event slid into the fun of my birthday.
What a way to welcome twenty-four!
I was Commander of minivan-related tactical ops.
I was the girl in red on the bike.
My experience with Journey started back in October, when, Dax told me about this amazing experience he had had in San Fransisco playing this game called Journey to the end of the night.
As the story of venturing through a city late at night, hunted by mysterious people with red ribbons unfolded, my eyes widened with delight and amazement.
Too bad I had missed it and it had happened on the other side of the country.
One Grey winter Chicago afternoon, Dax told me he was putting together the Chicago version of the game!
I was delighted and wanted to be involved in any way possible, as long as it involved wearing a ridiculous costume.
Later it was decided that I would be on bike chasing.
and video taping.
1: The Costume
Let it be known that the cape and helmet are my usual bike riding attire, but as it is sufficiently ridiculous, and it had been my intention to turn that into my SF0 character it seemed the perfect opportunity to let Beetlebomb out into the wide world of tasking.
I augmented my usual helmet and cape with a pair of black leggings a red and white cheerleading skirt, legwarmers and a red hoodie and I was ready to fly.
2: The Camera
The camera seemed best to attach to the helmet as there I would have the most control over it.
I did this by attaching a ribbon to the existing hardware of the camera around the bottom edge of the helmet and gaff taping over it then placing additional gaff over the camera itself.
I then taped tin foil over it to protect it from the rain that threatened that evening.
The result made it look a bit like a burrito.
See below
As I rode to the starting line, the tin foil paid itâ??s dues as it was raining pretty significantly.
There were fears as the tape seemed to loosen with the moisture in the air which was tentatively solved by more and more tape which seemed to work in the same mediocre manner as its predecessors, but it was deemed as satisfactory and after meeting up at wicker park and receiving my red ribbon I rode of to await my first victim.
After waiting on a side street off of Elston  I saw the first group of players run past.
As they ran past I heard one say 
Player 1:â??We better watch outâ?
Player2: â??Why?
â?
(I emerge from the shadows behind them)
Player1: â??THATâ??S WHY!
â?
They hurriedly run in all directions.
(they are in a safe zone, but they donâ??t know that) I narrow in on one and after a few minutes of chasing, he pulls a quick 180 and a duck behind a row of cars and I loose him.
I cycle back up Elston to await more victims.
Then I see them: a group of 6 or 7 targets
I approach, there is a moment of tension, when they donâ??t know if Iâ??m a chaser or not.
I turn and head straight for them.
They scream and scatter.
I zero in on a man with dark brown curly hair he bolts straight down Elston.
He tries the same move behind the cars but this time Iâ??m ready for it, the pursuit continues.
He continues SE on Elson to where it ends at a Verizon wireless store.
I chased him around the perimeter of this store for a few minutes before trying to go the other direction to appear in front of him.
This did not work out as planed and he made it down a back alley and got away from me.
-At the finish line we met again ,and he admitted that this pursuit was his favorite part of the journey, (I must say it was one of mine too) he also added that after escaping my clutches, he ran as hard as he could for several minutes before realizing he was going in the wrong direction.
Upon leaving Him, I turn around to find a member of his departed group.
After a brief chase she realizes the bikes disadvantage, and jumps over a short wall and continues on her way.
I see that by the time I lift the bike over the wall or go around the building attached to it, she will be long gone.
So I go in search of greener pastures.
There is a third group.
The have just exited the safe zone.
And instead of turning around and retreating a few feet, they scatter.
One is two slow and I tag him as he stands a few feet from safety.
He hands over his blue ribbon and we both go in search of his friends.
They have scattered but a few have gone into a little courtyard of an apartment complex 
In the process of chasing them around said courtyard, I impale my more sensitive regions on the bike lock in front of the seat, which made the rest of the night a little more uncomfortable, and stopped me just long enough for them to get away.
After a bit more scattering and scaring of a few more groups I proceeded to the next checkpoint.
I got a bit turned around and overshot the next check point, but I got to chase someone over a huge bridge, and met up with my friend and fellow chaser Snore.
After a brief discussion of tactics I turned around in search of tea and cupcakes.
After delicious vegan cupcakes and quick conversation at checkpoint2, I took a moment to study the map, then headed down Kinzie, towards the third check point.
I chased five or six groups, one of which I ended up chasing two or three times.
and at one point they almost got hit by a car in their escape efforts.

docid=-888095188500363666andhl=en
 At another point I had stopped for a moment to study the map and upon looking up I saw a runner.
we exchanged a knowing glance and he bolted for a parking garage.
I tried to follow him in but almost got run over by an SUV and had to turn around.
(I latter found out this was Calix)
Then I headed down to check point four.
Upon pulling up to the check point I was re directed to in between five and six.
On my way down to Roosevelt, an inebriated man walking by asked me if I was Batgirl,.
Iâ??m sure thinking himself very clever.
I politely told him I was not, and continued on my way
 
Down on Roosevelt was the slowest part of the game for me.
Despite A half hour vigil next to a drycleaners and a watchful eye I did not see a single runner.
After a long while I saw some chasers across the street, who upon closer inspection was Star5 and some other familiar faces.
We talked for a few minutes and Dax showed up.
He told me I was not to catch any more people that evening, and as the memory of the delightful cupcakes from checkpoint 2 were making my tummy rumble, I decided to head to the finish line.
Upon finally finding the finish line, I enjoyed several cupcakes and was excited to hear that I had scared the crap out of many more people than I had realized.
All in all it was a fantabulous evening!
Iâ??m so glad to have been a part of it.
Sorry for the lack of documentation Later I found out that the footage
from the burrito-cam was decided to be unusable.
The footage and few
pictures posted is from my little digital camera which was hard to
handle while
 chasing and riding a bike.
Addendem: When I moved here last fall, the idea of riding my bike around the city was exciting, but the idea of riding it downtown was terrifying.
Till last spring I had ridden down town on one or two occasions, and was a little traumatized.
Since playing Journey, I have been riding my bike downtown quite often, and find that I enjoy the experience, though I don't appreciate the lack of bike lanes.
This game allowed me the ability to see the place where I live in a different way.
It pushed me past my boundaries and I find I'm happier here in this new playground of a city.
It wasn't until recently that I realized what a big impact this game, and SF0 have had on my life and the way I view whats around me, and I want to thank all of you for making my world a wierder and more wonderful place.
(rough copy for now)
-Signed up with all the other Journeymen/women at the Embarcadero, and downed a tallboy to warm up.
This turned out to be a bad idea 5 minutes into the race, when my pack started getting chased.
Luckily, I'm still able to run in short bursts before my tar-coated lungs begin to burn me.
-Hit the first few stops without major incident then we approached the checkpoint at It's Tops.
When we spotted purple ribboned chasers approaching from all directions and modes of transit (foot, bike, go-kart), we just sprinted to the safety zone.
Only half of us made it, but we waited around a few minutes to give them a chance.
While waiting for the F line to get out of there, we noticed some new chasers: our less fleet-of-foot companions.
At this point, I decided to abandon team tactics, and become a ninja.
-Getting to the next spot (the pool hall) was pretty easy, aside from one guy I had to evade using my hide-in-shadows skill.
On the Geary bus, I spotted some more blue ribbons, and joined on with them.
-Escaping this stop was a little tricky: I ran off on a side street, while the others took a bus i the opposite direction.
I thought I'd lost them, but they turned up on the 43 bus I had mentioned earlier.
We ride it to the south side of GG park, and stealthily approach the memorial grove through the woods.
This turned out to be unneccesary, as we didn't spot any chasers the whole way.
Still, the park is creepy enough at night to provide a few thrills.
-Same deal on the way to the last checkpoint, and on to the beach.
My friends and I got to the meeting site about an hour early.
Did some stretches and started spotting people with costumes arriving.
Justin Herman Plaza at 6:05pm, SF0 sign on the bottom there.
7:40pm

Once the horn sounded, it was funny hearing all the car horns going off.
It was literally a mad dash.
My friends and I decided to go to 1B instead of 1A.
Got there in 10 minutes.
We survived the other checkpoints by walking as if we weren't watching out for chasers.
Kept our cool and it was funny to see chasers walking past us while they were in lookout mode.
Encountered the Glowing Safety Jellyfish at Duboce Park at 10:58pm.
She really had a cute costume, even had the jellyfish movements too.
Wished that I had taken a better photo.
Night mode on my camera is not to be trusted.
Got to the finish line at 12:23am and there was a costume contest.
The Glowing Safety Jellyfish and Superman were the favorites.
The Journey To The End Of The Night is over for me and my friends.
The glowstick path was pretty cool.
Here are my runner and chaser ribbon and commemorative badge and the credits for Journey To The End Of The Night

Here's my completed manifest.
Here's my map.
My only regret is not taking better pictures.
All in all, I'm proud to say that \I was there.'
Thanks for taking the time to glance at my report.
What is this?
No you can't.
what is all of this?
' The Government Center security guard was alarmed and confused.
His timing couldn't have been worse, as far as I was concerned.
We'd just teamed up to assemble a rain shelter for the ladies of stage three, they'd set their dinner table and lit their candle and everything.
His name tag read 'Tyrone' and he wasn't a cop, he was building security.
'We're having a picnic,' I started out, gamely.
'Aw no.
You can't be here with this thing.
'
'But it's a public place.
It's public property.
'
'Naw this here is the government building.
'
'They're outside.
Nobody's in the building.
' 
 Then my phone was ringing.
For the twenty second time in two hours.
OliverX--just five minutes after Star5 had called to note the first very determined group of runners had just come through her stage two ('I guess they know the buses,' she said).
I assume Oliver was calling because I'd just texted to tell him Dok Harmon, the lead chaser had a dead phone and that someone needed to get  a handle on the staff chasers because stage two was at risk of turning into a deathtrap.
Of course Oliver was calling because no one had told him the phone numbers of the other staff chasers.
But I had to let it go because Tyrone from the Hennepin County Government Center was agitated and trying to figure out what the heck was going on.
He was also insisting we had to leave.
Journey to the End of the Night Minnesota had been running for an hour and everything was melting down.
But hold on.
How did we get here?
Obviously we overcame numerous challenges to launch this version of Journey to the End of the Night.
You can read about pre-event planning and work here at Eleanor's praxis.
The proof you're reading now focuses on the event itself, whereas Eleanor's and my alter-ego's is full of (hopefully interesting) pre event detail.
The two experiences of the Journeyâ??planning it and executing itâ??are so distinct, and lengthy, it made sense to break into two praxis proofs, with the non-Unit part of my personality doing the heavy lifting elsewhere.
Particularly since Eleanor made some nice contributions and I wanted her help to be recognized!
Arriving at the start we got to cutting lengths of ribbon (maybe a little too short?
from what I could see--since I put the measurement mark out there, it's my bad!
) and handing out manifests.
Ink Tea called with a problem we should have expected, and very funny (a flat tire.
on the bike chaser's bike).
We asked people to sign a waiver and hang on for instructions.
We had one drunk on hand who wanted to heckle me, which was annoying, but given our location (the riverfront woods in the Old Main area are popular hideouts), only one drunk on hand should be considered getting off pretty easy!
With the clearing skyline behind me, we talked through the rules a little bit, and sent them on their way (I missed a couple notes I'd wanted to make, shoot, and I didn't say 'deep breath.
' which would have been cool).
JJason and OliverX gave their battle cries (they're battle cries were 'RUN!
') and got some of the folks to get running.
Then the phone calls started in earnest.
'I just found a parking spot because I didn't realize there was an event and I only found a meter.
I put in enough for 30 minutes,' it was Mean Jeannine.
We'd basically hung her out to dry: even though stage one was only going to be open an hour, it sure didn't make sense to have her risk a ticket for staffing it.
Not only that, but we'd designated Stage One as the place to go if people came late to the game--we even had a sign up at the start when we left telling people where to head.
So she needed ribbon supplies, among other things.
Since I was going to take JJason to his spot as stage five agent, and then swing by to set up the women of stage three, I lit out for stage one.
JJason came with me to help Mean Jeannine.
It was a good thing too, because we noticed all these runners ambling through the stage.
'Go get them to quit fucking ambling,' I snarled.
I believe that is what I snarled.
Anyway, JJason hopped out to have some fun.
But my phone was ringing.
'I just caught a resurrection ribbon,' it was Dok.
He was lead staff chaser and had just gotten nailed by our in-game trickery.
Damn, that was.
unexpected.
Bad contingency planning.
'Okay.
Good luck?
' I was laughing pretty hard, which is not very nice.
But what could we do, we'd found one key hole in our game mechanics and got caught bein' fancy.
I think I just couldn't believe it happened so soon.
We should have thought of that one ahead of time.
Immunized the lead chaser or all staff.
Had him discreetly run to a hidden location and put a red ribbon back on.
Told him who the sleepers were.
Something.
A truly adventurous spirit, Dok  decided to see what would happen next, promising to keep in touch with me as the night wore on.
Having inspired some fear, JJason returned to the van to hear me cackling about Dok's strange blessing (may you live in interesting times, right?
We drove over to Mean Jeannine's car and plugged her meter (JJason pursued a couple more chasers.
At this point I really regretted not festooning the van with red ribbons as we'd discussed once upon a time).
Time slipping away we headed west, to get into downtown and set up the women of checkpoint three.
The cost of this was I didn't deliver all the 'SAFE AREA' signs I wanted to.
For example, paying a visit to checkpoint two with some might have clarified things, or at least enabled us to remain true to the promises we'd made on the manifests.
But my phone rang again, interrupting my internal debate about whether or not to go back to stage two before hitting up three.
It was Mean Jeannine.
'Craig was just here and he asked me to call you,' she said.
I was relaxing, thinking 'good, he's back in.
 Then she dropped the bomb, 'His phone is dead.
He said 'you'll know what to do.
'' 
 Shit.
I love tasks with 'You'll know what to do' instructions.
I think they're a critical piece of SF0 culture.
Like the hole in our resurrection rules though, this one caught me flat footed.
no Dok, I surely do not know.
But then, in a moment of confidence, I felt an inkling.
Your character never misses a connection - it will get you Score.
'Thanks.
You can close up pretty soon.
'  I rang off and relayed the news to JJason.
We had another laugh and just as I started texting OliverX, Star5 called me to let me know the lead group was moving out of stage 2.
This was a problem because we didn't have 3 set up yet!
The gals were there but I had really wanted to provide them a shelter just in case it rained again.
Also it would make the point look cool.
So the text to OliverX got modified:Dok cell is dead.
You are in charge of chasers until further notice.
You are immune to resurrection (still give them 30 secs.
) Hit lead group hard now out of stage 2 pls.
Then another: They know the buses so we need to slow them a bit 'You people can't all be here with this thing,' said Tyrone.
'They're just having a picnic.
'
 'Y'all can't have a picnic with this thing.
How long you been out here?
'
 'What?
' I was determined to work any advantage and I figured if we made it look like we had momentum and like he'd dropped the ball not noticing us, Tyrone would let it ride.
'It's not so bad.
We've been here like forty-five minutes already!
'
We'd moved up to stage three.
There were three beautiful women in nice outfits here, ready for a picnic dinner.
Windelina said they had brought placemats and napkins.
They also had crackers and frosting (I heartily approve!
) and some teacakes.
They wanted to know what to do and what the rules were, so we kinda scattershot told them, while scoping out good places to hang SAFE AREA signs and cutting yellow ribbons for them.
Throughout all this we'd teamed up to assemble the sunshade/rain shelter (hope it didn't rain sideways tonight!
) and the low camper table I had brought for them.
Things were getting settled when our buddy Tyrone had showed up.
I felt like we were getting him to take it easy on us, maybe let us stay or maybe let us set up further away from the building.
All hope that negotiation and weaseling was going to work flew out the window though, when the lead group of runners hit the plaza.
Diligent inspirer that he was, JJason pursued them across the SAFE AREA line, and they were baring down on our little group just as I heard Tyrone say it was okay to have our picnic on the plaza as long as we took down the shelter.
But a gaggle of runners thundering into the location meant our jig was up: this was no weirdo picnic, something was officially going down and I'd been bullshitting Tyrone to his face, not very successfully, but it was still exposed.
The running and shouting meant  shenanigans were afoot.
'Woah woah!
You can't!
' Tyrone was pretty much at his limit.
'Okay okay.
We're playing a gameâ??'
 
 'Naw!
You can't be here like this yall gotta go,' I think I could see the paperwork piling up behind his eyes: '9/13/08 19:55.
Riot-like activities in plaza, several persons wearing blue armbands attacked, this officer apprehended leader and dialed 911 for backup.
' 
 'It's a game.
This is one of the safe points in the game,' I admitted.
'I'm sorry.
We'll take it down if we can just stay.
I thought it was a public place.
Can we please just set up overâ??' something must have descended on us from above in that moment because Tyrone relented.
'You all can just move over there.
I don't care, you just can't have this on the Government Center property.
' 
 
 'Over there?
By the light rail?
'
 
 'Yeah sure.
Just go ahead.
Go on over to the city hall side, let them deal with y'all.
' 
 
 'There's no reason to break this tent down if he doesn't care,' interjected Windelina, ever a voice of reason.
'Don't take it apart if he doesn't care.
' 
 She was right.
We enlisted the runners to help us move it.
They looked a little wild-eyed (after all we were delaying them from their date with destiny, and they were getting an unplanned look underneath the skirts of my bad contingency planning).
'So are you guys cool?
' I was anxious to get moving because runners present meant we were behind again.
Windelina and Alis waved me off.
I hollered for my shotgun: 'JJason!
We gotta move on!
' He ran over and we were gone.
OliverX and I conversed more on the phone about things, and I twittered everyone that checkpoint one was closed.
Suddenly things were opening up.
If the lead group had just been diverted from the race by helping the stage agents with their relocation.
We buzzed over to Loring Park.
It was finally dark when we got there.
Yes, I murmured.
Yes, we're ahead.
We're going to make it.
Curio Sir was waiting for us.
I parked the van and flipped on the hazards, and ran around to the back.
We hefted out the desk and hauled it over to a park bench in the safe zone.
I reached into my bag of tricks once more, much to the delight of Curio Sir, when I said 'I brought a laptop for you to work on while sitting at your desk.
' It was a Tandy 102 portable.
He was appropriately excited (not that I had the power supply, but whatever) and we set him up.
I hoped it was as eerie a situation as anything we'd placed on the route.
It sure looked cool as we hustled back to the van.
Ink Tea biked up at that moment.
I was a little nervous that it meant we weren't as far ahead as we should have been.
But of course she was on a bike.
She was doing great, there weren't any runners near yet, and things were starting to sound really fun for everyone.
Oh gawd, I'd left the van running!
No wonder I couldn't find the keys.
That was risky.
JJason piled in and we were off again, to Spyhouse and then to the finish.
He bearded up (ridiculous!
outrageous!
) and I dropped him off (a moment's panic while we tried to find the yellow ribbon).
Another twitter message: Mothra activation sequence initiated JJason had requested that at least one point in the night we mention something about Mothra over the twitter feed.
Word on the street is that I picked just the right moment, for at least one group got very paranoid.
I checked in with a couple of my sleeper agents, who reported that things were going very well.
I let one of them off the hook because I figured he didn't need to ruin everything for everyone just then.
I can be nice.
I drove down to Symphony Place and started pulling together my stuff.
I called Kannon and Mattack!
to let them know I was on site.
I think I caught Kannon off guard because they were out.
She was cool though, and we agreed to meet down at the fountains.
I walked over.
I used colored cloth to cover my stuff, laid out the Fowers of Courage and Valor on one of the platforms,  donned my robe and removed my shoes.
Sitting in a quasi-lotus, barefoot among the flowers, I opened my umbrella.
This must have been the linchpin for bystanders, as from that moment I think I became an object of unsettling dread.
I sat in peace for a while, meditatively reflecting on how it was going, enjoying the cool air, and smiling.
I answered the next few phone calls with joy in my voice.
I hoped people felt it.
I remembered to walk to the perimeter and put up my signs, which on reflection were too tightly spaced.
Sorry runners.
As I sat, fielding more phone calls and beginning to worry about the level of charge in my battery, a woman approached.
'Hi there!
' She was all smiles.
Middle aged, nice pantsuit, close cropped hair.
'Hi!
' I replied, in beatific-manic mode.
'What are ya doin' tonight?
'
 'I'm waiting for my friends to come!
' I smiled again.
Then I noticed her smile become a little.
at the edges.
'Do ya really think your friends are gonna show up?
' she asked, kind of leaning down now, hands on her upper thighs like one might address a child.
she thinks I'm a crazy person.
she's talkin to me like a crazy person.
it must be the robe and the umbrella with no rain.
it could rain.
I broke.
I couldn't help it.
Dropping the big face, I used my normal, non-manic speaking level, 'Actually yes.
We are playing a giant game of tag and I'm like the last home base.
If you look over at those signs?
Yeah, they say 'safe zone' on 'em and they tell the runners where they can go to be safe from chasers.
I'm just waiting for the first group of runners to come to the finish line.
That's what these flowers are for' 
 'Oh!
Oh I just think that's great!
Ya, what a good idea!
You have fun now!
' she toddled off.
I resumed sitting.
I observed clusters of red-ribboned men and women stalking along the top of my perimeter.
I waved at some, smiling.
ssurrious, so I let them be.
Ink Tea called in with a hilarious anecdote about all the chaos and mayhem on the stretch run to checkpoint four.
Apparently there were chasers and runners everywhere and they all ran each other ragged.
Other proofs have mention of this riot of excitement and tests of nerve and verve.
I noticed another woman approaching, this time from across the fountain plaza from the direction of a big event that was going on over there.
She was carrying something.
I hung up hastily and focused on her.
She had a plate?
Two plates?
'Oh my gosh,' she said.
She gestured with the plate.
Maybe seeing the cell phone in my hand she realized her mistake.
'Oh my husband thought you were a homeless person and told me to bring you this.
' 
 I burst out laughing.
'What?
we'reâ??'
 'My husband said lookit there's a man over there he's homelessâ??
 'No!
I'm the finish line.
playing a game.
Thank you!
'
 'Okay well, I thought.
Yah,' she was laughing too.
She held out the plate to me.
What could I say?
I took that food.
I was famished, too.
Though I can't say overdone cold hamburgers are my favorite, I was not going to look this particular gift horse in the mouth.
Some people appeared at this point, running in from all directions.
'Thank you!
Thank you, I have to talk to these folks.
'
 
 'Oh yah.
Well, you take care now!
' 
Then the excitement was upon us: the first runners had arrived!
The first guy in the house was Neil, a very happy and tired looking gent.
I embraced himâ??tried to hug everybody that night, I think people didn't mind too much since I tried not to be creepy about it.
He felt elated and yet not greatâ??apparently he was the victor by dint of acquiring someone else's mostly complete manifest 30 seconds from the end.
A hole in the resurrection ribbon concept, since the manifest rules said 'first one across with a complete manifest wins'.
Who teh hell planned this thing anyway?
) Shortly after him came Max and Dylan, still sporting blue ribbons.
They were the first start-to-finish runners and went home with the runner trophy.
(I have since learned they might have made an unholy alliance to get it.
Interesting.
That's another quirk of the rules I suppose: nobody said they couldn't.
It's an interesting strategy.
What might it imply for the long term?
) Neil doesn't know this, but I'm building him a trophy, I'll call it the Lacuna Prize (aka, the 'you ran fair and square and don't deserve to get screwed out of a trophy just because the planners didn't think through the implications award') and deliver it to him soon.
It's impossible to convey all the excitement of people as they arrived, the drama, the sense of how many had bonded as they raced through the town.
The feeling they'd just achieved something they were really proud of and surprised by.
One chaser said, 'This is the most fun I've had all year man.
Seriously.
This was the best.
' 
 
 Star5, Kannon and Mattack made their way down to the finish eventually, once they got the afterparty location ready to go.
They conducted our dozens of new best friends up to the warm and welcoming confines of Kannon's fancy party room and pool area, where food was eaten, acquaintances became friendships,  and stories became legend.
I remained, occasionally popping open my umbrella and holding flowers, ready to open my arms  for anyone risking it all.
We chatted up chasers, runners, stage agents, all of 'em.
The stories flowed around me, the excitement of the evening now rolling in wavesâ??though never commonplaceâ??regularly crashing upon my little island.
Loki showed up, we had a couple words, basked a bit.
He had taken the Chaser mantle and kept things at just the right level of excitement for runners down at the end.
He'd done a quick sweep and we felt confident closing down the final stage around 11:45.
From there, it was a single block walk and a quick elevator ride to the afterparty, a whirl of celebration and camaraderie, high above the city we'd claimed.
We owned now.
For this night.

This is a story of paranoia, hills and patience.
This is my story, the story of one of the last people to cross the finish line.

     We took off due south from the park, hoping to avoid chasers and take advantage of the local bus system.
Some in the party looked for bus schedules but could not find them.
We began to become convinced that it didn't exist.
Our plans thwarted, we moved on.
Lesson learned being chased in residential areas, with small streets and plenty of cover for chasers, is perhaps the most terrifying of situations (this leads me to believe a suburban Journey would be especially scary).
As we drew closer to the park we began to see other groups of people wandering about, usually on side streets.
Were they chasers or runners?
For a variety of reasons (adrenaline, I have a horrible memory) I cannot precisely recall the card I drew at Bex's fortune telling Bryce seemed to think I drew Temperance.
Yet I have an image in my mind of a man riding a gondola of sorts, probably associated with the Wands suit because he seemed to be navigating through/around some sticks in the background.
I could be making all of this up.
Adrenaline was running high and clouds my memory.
In any case, I was about to make many more things up.

     This is where it started getting freaky.
(maps)
We headed out of the north entrance of the park, where we suspected we would be able to avoid many chasers.
We were already on edge, eager both to make up for lost time and to stay as far away from chasers as possible.
Were chasers using babies as disguise?
, I thought to myself.
And he was headed toward me, now.
Shit
Of course,

     By this time I had been a full 20 minutes without my group and was fairly certain I'd never see any of them ever again.
I started up Lakeshore Dr.
looking for a way up the hill.
All of a sudden someone ducked under a bush right before my eyes.
I was too paranoid for words so I motioned to my green armband.
I may have said, \hey\'.'
He warned me of chasers immediately up the road and worried about being pinned down.
I told him that I was headed up into the hills and that he was welcome to follow.
After a few steps I had time to find out his name was Ben, that he had been separated from his group recently, and that he wasn't sure if any of them were still running.
Great, I thought.
More SF0 Bens.
Ours was a pairing that, at first, felt pretty ephemeral.
He stayed across the street from me and about 5 yards behind.
Later on, he told me that, in fact, he didn't trust me at all, and was convinced I was leading him into a trap so my chaser friends could catch him.
I laughed when I heard this, because chasers are not your friends.
I had the misfortune of spinning the wheel and landing on \Lowteck decides your fate!'

     At this point, we hadn't seen a chaser in at least two checkpoints.
I arrived at the ferry terminal, not sure what to expect.
Thinking this was going to be more of a MARCH then a game.
Just a walk across the city is all i was thinking.
I was given a map, and I was thrown into a Team.
Tim, Gabe and Alan.
We got our ribbons and then hit a MUNI map to plan our attack.
We swapped cell phone numbers just in case we got seperated.
I still have them to this day, and who knows what i will do with them in the future.
The race started and we sprinted along with everyone else.
the sprints turned to struts.
and the struts turned to walking after everyone was tired.
My group fought it out and ran all the way through the embarcadaro shopping centers before hitting a walking speed.
We were walking up a main bus route, checking behind us every few steps for a \1\' bus to take us to the top of the hill.'
At the top of the hill was checkpoint 1.
The lobby of a fancy pants SF tourist hotel.
On the way we got seperated by our first run in with some \chasers\'.'
We all split up and ran different directions, the cell phones came in handy at this moment to get us back on track and back into the communication circle.
Tim was the only one being wishywashy about meeting us again.
it seemed kinda fishy, but we thought nothing of it.
(later we found out he was tagged, and he was trying to meet up with us.
SNEAKY SNEAKY!
)
Alan, Gabe and I catch a bus and get down to Van Ness.
Our next stop is to head down to Market street and find a \lady in a trench coat eating by herself\'.'
We got a bit spun around on marketstreet since addresses aren't clearly labeled it appears.
We find her, no problem and start conversing a little.
and take a little breather.
Our next stop is a girl with a broken wrist in a billiard hall.
We decide to take a really long round about route, heeding the word of a few random players saying \chasers\' are all along the main routes.'
On this long bus ride, in a wrap around route, Gabe pulls us aside.
I have bad news.
\
Toom
\I'm a defector.'
\as soon as you get off this bus
We work out a deal to have Gabe goto the back of the bus, so when it stops, we have a couple seconds head start.
He agrees.
Alan mutters to me.
\stay close to me.'
We bolt out and start running.
We manage to make it to Alans gate.
and it was obvious Gabe let us in.
he coulda tagged us as we were fiddling with keys.
We laugh about it with him through the gate and we go upstairs to play the \Waiting game\'.'
Alan gets some dinner (special K cereal) and I chug some water.
We wait about 10~15 minutes before attempting to go outside again.
Leaving his house was the scariest moment of the night.
he could be anywhere.
Behind any car, behind any bush, waiting to jump out at us.
Alan and I agree to run to opposite sides of the street, across from each other.
so one of us will be sacrificed so the other can keep playing.
Gabe doesn't jump us!
We are sort of disapointed but also relieved we get to continue the game.
We make it to a bus 43 and take it to Geary.
just 1 block from the billiard hall.
Shortly after heading towards the 4th stop (middle of golden gate park), we get ambushed by a crazy chaser.
screaming at us like a cowboy.
I am completely seperated from my group and take a long round about way to the center of goldengate park, where i somehow meet up with alan and a bunch of other players on some super dark path.
I say \Hello there!'
By the way, it's so dark out here that you would see just as well if you closed your eyes.
The confusion is cleared up and I join the group to get to the center of the park.
During this time Alan and the group already went to pit stop 5.
They went out of order.
the cheaters!
Being the honest player I am.
i went to stop 5 to finish the game an get my log.
I left the group and walked many many blocks since the busses completel suck at the past 11pm weekend schedule.
Inside the laundromat was my buddy Orion.
He was working the last stop as \a man doing laundry\' I was the last player there.'
and I went with him on the bus down to the bonfire to burn my log.
I stayed until every piece of my fabric was stained with the stench of bonfire, and then I headed back out to my home to get some rest.
An excellent night.
(this is written months after the event, and hastily before bed.
This story is going to be mainly a \pull back the curtain\' look into what we planned and organized for the Journey
But first, a feeling and a story.
Feeling

Imagine, if you will, hundreds of people gathered before you.
They are excited, and a little bit twitchy.
They are about to run through the city, where unknown dangers and rewards await them.
They donâ??t know what to expect--but tonight, the city will be a different beast entirely.
It will be a place of adventure and danger, of narrow escapes and exhausted panic.
Whatever their night is like, they will have stories to be told later.
But right now, they do not know what those stories will be.
They may hope.
They may think they know.
But right now, they are waiting to see how the future unfolds.
They are waiting to be released.
They are waiting for you.
They are ready.
And then they are gone.
Story

It can be a dangerous thing, to plan a Journey.
Particularly when we found out that another journey was being planned for the same day.
We could not move (it is the last weekend before all the students leave) neither could they (Dax would be in town only for that weekend).
And so we began to hatch a plan, Dax and I.
This has long been tickling the back of my head, and so my first envoy to Dax was, \I think we can get our 500.'
But it was a process of negotiation, figuring out how to compromise on time (we would release late, at 8 they would release early at 7) and cross-city interaction.
We came up with many ideas, some involving ringing public pay phones that players could pick up (sadly, it turns out that while some public phones still exist, none of them accept incoming calls), relying on players in the other city to find checkpoint locations, or secret envelopes given to players.
In the end, the ideas were simple: Chicago players had, on their map, a secret code which would help DC players.
DC players had a secret location, which would help Chicago players.
If they could get in contact, they could trade and both benefit.
To encourage this, we made it well-known beforehand that people should find a counterpart in the other city in addition, we published the phone numbers for each bonus checkpoint on the opposite map.
If a player called it, they might be able to talk to a cross-city player and gain a fortuitous connection.
We also had a Chicago-themed checkpoint in DC, and planned to trigger a Mothra transformation (turning a chaser into a second Good Player Fairy) in DC when the first Chicago player reached the bonus checkpoint.
But we also wanted to make sure that while people were aware of the other city, they didn't need to know about it to enjoy the basic thrill of Journey.
That they could simply chase or be chased through the city streets, having the visceral experience of fear and paranoia, danger and speed.
Next time, though.
next time, we might be more ambitious.
Details

All right, here we go.
There's so much to be told (as there always is after a Journey), so I'll try to stick to the most interesting parts.
Let me just give a brief thanks to everyone who helped make this happen: there were about thirty people who all worked very hard to make this happen, and I'm tremendously grateful for it.
Timeline and Twitter

This year, we decided to try twitter for during-game status updates.
The idea was pretty simple: chasers would twitter where they were going, and how many they had caught.
This would allow the lead chaser to direct them to ramp up or down as needed.
Checkpointers would twitter when people reached their checkpoints this would allow further checkpointers to see when people would be arriving, and also let the chasers know approximately where people were throughout the route.
A bonus result was that we could, at the end of the game, pull together all the messages to create a timeline.
I think it gives a really fun way to envision the night, and see what various people were doing.
The collected timeline is here.
Go ahead--check it out I'm really quite inordinately proud of it.
But remember to come back here for more.
People

We got more people than we expected.
More than we'd hoped for, really.
At first, things were going pretty well a few hundred visitors per day (mainly from facebook or from direct email), some of whom signed up--things were on track for a good-sized journey.
It looked like there was a good chance of our breaking 300, so I doubled the initial ribbon order (ending up with 1200 feet each of orange and blue).
Then, during the week leading up to the Journey, things got crazy.
Literally every time I checked my email, it would be filled with new signups.
So I started to worry about our preparations.
Even after finding the leftover from last year, I was scrambling for emergency last-minute ribbon.
By the time the game started, 550 players had signed up: last year, we got about a hundred more than had signed up--but this year?
What would the impending rain do?
Would the numbers increase further?
In the end, I had two backup plans: first.
if we ran out of ribbon, be prepared to use the ribbon from medals.
if even that failed, we would cut all the ribbons in half and have people tie them around their wrists.
We ended up with 638 players, which narrowly made our quota: if 4 more people had shown up, we would have gone into the prize ribbon (which could have put us up to about 700 if needed).
(By the way, a word of advice to anyone running a Journey: if it looks like rain, buy an umbrella on the day of the Journey.
So far, this has been 3 for 3 in preventing rain.
)
638 was a lot of people to put unto Dupont circle.
This is a pretty hastily-made panorama here:

But you might also want to check some other people's crowd shots, like this one, to give a sense of the number.
We took over Dupont Circle.
It was a lot of people.
This year, people made it to the checkpoints in the following numbers:
Start: 638
CP 1: 600
CP 2: 440
CP 3: 241
CP 4: 191
CP 5: 110
CP 6: 85
CP Bonus: 220+
Give me another few years of data, and I'll see if I can get a survival analysis going, using distance from previous checkpoint, distance to nearest metro, and checkpoint number.
sorry, was I drooling?
Anyway, I'm very curious about modeling this, so other Journeys are encouraged to send me data if you have it.
I have some thoughts on why so few people survived down below, and how to increase the number.
The first team to finish was the amazing trio, Fireteam Camelot!
You'll see several notes regarding them in the timeline, as \3 marines\'.'
They were a lot of fun--all of the checkpoints said they were great sports, and they hung out at the final checkpoint for a while.
We have their email addresses, and come next year, you should look out for three speedy chasers on the streets.
The Route

The Google Map shows the checkpoints, safe zones, and the direct route from checkpoint to checkpoint for the main course.
No one went direct, I'm sure (the fear of the chasers was well-deserved), but the direct route was 7 miles (also not including the bonus checkpoint).
As with any Journey, I think choosing a good route and good checkpoint locations is one of the most critical things.
This should be done as early as possible, so you can check the route and make sure it makes sense.
Because not only should they be good places for checkpointers to set up, but they should encourage some public transit.
without making it too easy and not be too far, but far enough (especially early on) to separate players out.
Bonus Boxes

One of the new additions this year was the presence of a \bonus box\' at each checkpoint.'
Each one was a closed box with a combination lock.
Within lay a prize that would assist the player with their journey--if they were lucky enough to find the combination.
I'll go through each of them (and their codes) in the checkpoint section below.
I think this worked fairly well--some people got the bonuses, and it seemed like players liked the concept of secret information spread throughout the city.
Good Player Fairy

This is another innovation I'd been thinking of, and which we put into play this year.
The problem is thus: some chasers will \camp\' checkpoint entrances or exits
Once there are a certain number of chasers in the game, this can make it nearly impossible for players to get in or out of a checkpoint, which makes it very difficult for things to progress.
One of the ways to fix this is to make the safe zones large enough to provide many exist and entrances.
Another is the Good player Fairy.
The Good Player Fairy's role is to wander the course, specifically going to places where chasers are making it impossible for players to get through.
While within 10 feet of the Good Player Fairy, no captures can be made.
This makes them, essentially, a roaming bubble of protection, to be summoned as needed or to act as they whimsically desire.
To keep them from being abused, they have discretion over how quickly or how directly to proceed to the next checkpoint, or even whether to move at all.
Fairies are not always predictable.
This was, I think, a great success, and one that should be repeated and extended.
It was also a great way to protect players and have more of them make it safely through the night.
incircles was a great player fairy: he seemed to have a lot of fun, and I think was a fantastic element in the game.
The temporary protection he offered reminded players that once they left it, they would once more be at the mercy of the chasers.
The Bonus Checkpoint

This was also our first year with a bonus checkpoint.
I had no idea how many people would go for it, or what precisely to reward people with.
In the end, I just made things up and went with it.
The bonus checkpoint was a huge success, with over a third of the players going there.
I'd provided them with bonus box items to give out, as well as the ability to give combinations for other bonus boxes.
But I think the success (as with just about any checkpoint) really came from having great people running it.
The Yellow House is filled with some of the most talented and wonderful people I know, and they did not disappoint.
Their theme?
Magnum PI Tiki theme.
With polar bear, of course.
In keeping with this, and in a wonderful tie-in to SF0's moustache tradition, the bonus checkpointers would prove that people had visited their checkpoint by drawing a moustache on their face (for those with existing moustaches, they would accentuate it with long curly ends or similar).
Their work speaks for itself.
For anyone who made it to the bonus, and also made it through every checkpoint, they would receive a brilliantly designed bonus checkpoint pin.
Checkpoints

CP 1: Directly in front of the White House, we'd thought about making a stronger connection to Chicago by emphasizing the Obama connection.
Instead, Bruce Witzenburg, leader of the DC Defenestrators, created a bureaucratic maze, forcing people to literally jump through hoops or perform other tasks in order to navigate through and finally get their checkpoint 1 stamp.
I believe they made the marines do pushups.
I don't believe this slowed them down.
The combination code for the first bonus box was 2-0-2 (Washington's area code), given out over the journeydc twitter feed just after the game started.
The bonus allowed players to use some of Washington's bus system.
CP 2: Chicago-themed, run by eccoglyph and Kprime.
They had the Chicago musical soundtrack playing the whole time, and constructed an amazing set of silhouettes.
This was at the Taft Memorial, which is dedicated not to President William H.
Taft, but to his son, Senator Robert A.
One person who came to the checkpoint was a history major, and gave an impromptu speech about Taft's powerful senate career but I think most surprising was that two of Taft's grandsons were runners in the Journey!
You can find pictures (and videos) here.
The combination for this checkpoint?
7-7-3, of course (Chicago's area code).
Acquiring this gave players access to /all/ of DC buses, as well as making bus stops into safe zones.
CP 3: 1950's home was the theme: Fizzbang made everyone draw a picture of what they wanted to be when they grew up.
He has a great twitter here, saying ' Most common: \Astronaut\'
  Also I liked his comment on Fireteam Camelot.
what did the three marines want to be when they grew up?
\A marine.'
)
You can see a couple of the drawings here, but I really want to see these scanned in for fizzbang's praxis!
We made the combination 7-7-3 here as well, to emphasize its importance.
Also--when it is late at night, and you are trying to fit lines into quarter-pages, it is nearly inevitable that you will start making one entirely in haiku.
CP 4: Camping/granola (on the Howard university campus), run by nano5th.
I don't actually know of any pictures from this checkpoint, but I heard they made people sing campfire songs.
:)  The code for this checkpoint, which housed the most powerful bonus in the game, was '4-1-5' (San Francisco's area code), which was posted on posters leading up to the bonus.
CP 5: Pastafarians.
These are believers in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, whose noodly appendage created the world and all things in it.
They also dressed as pirates, of course, to try and reduce global warming, in keeping with tenets of the church.
Find pictures here.
Combination: 4-1-2 (area code for Pittsburgh, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates) this was also in a pirate chest.
The bonus was my favorite, too:

Final Checkpoint: We ended at the Dupont Italian Kitchen, which was great--enough space to hold tons of people, fairly empty during the late night, and we didn't have to worry about providing food or drink for the party.
More importantly, we also had some people from SpeakeasyDC recording stories from people, and got some great audio recollections.
Take a listen!
You can find them (and links to all many other photo collections) here.
Chasers

We had a lot of great chasers this year.
Two bike chasers, which were reportedly almost as terrifying in DC as in Chicago.
\El Guapo\' was particularly good
Congrats to all of them!
Costumes

Our best costume winners put up pictures here.
Some Reflections: What Went Right and What Went Wrong

People had a really good time.
That's critical.
They had an adventure, they had terror.
They didn't all survive--but they all experienced their city anew, as a different, less trusted and less safe place--and also as a place where they could run, powerfully and swiftly, become agents seeking information and escaping from enemies.
The checkpoints were all fantastic.
They provided new worlds for the players to encounter in the city.
I was really impressed with how each one provided unusual and interesting oases of safety in the city.
They were really cool, and I think the players had a great time because of them.
One thing that was a problem last year was that the mass of players swarmed the early checkpoints at once, overwhelming them with hundreds of players in just a few minutes.
To try to avoid this, we did three things.
We increased the distance to the first checkpoint we loaded up on chasers between the start and the first checkpoint and we gave people the option of going to the bonus checkpoint first.
I should also mention that this year, we released on time (actually a little late) rather than surprising the chasers with players before they were ready.
I think these things worked pretty well to manage the crowd surge.
We also got specialty ink stampers made with the Journey logo, which was a lot faster than signing.
Even with this, checkpoint one got fairly well swarmed (though I think the red tape theme may have contributed to this).
Next year, though, I think it'd be good to have two stampers there (this year, they had someone signing in addition to the stamper).
On that note, I think that interacting with Chicago worked fairly well.
People seemed to enjoy being able to interact with Chicago players, especially to exchange bonuses.
I know a number of people talked via the bonus checkpoint.
I was disappointed that we never got a call from the Chicago checkpoint (which would have triggered our Mothra sequence, adding a second good player fairy, which would have helped more players make it through the course).
Our late release was due to some security guard trouble in Chicago.
But overall, I was really happy with the idea that there were people simultaneously running in both cities, having similar experiences even as they traveled different routes.
I continue to have the highest respect for Dax and the whole Chicago team, and was really glad to be able to get some cross-city interaction with them.
After reading the rules to the players, we waited until 8 PM (about fifteen minutes) before releasing them.
In the future, I don't think we actually need to wait.
We did it to make sure people had arrived (and this year, to coordinate with Chicago), but we had plenty of people in time this year.
I also need to write a shorter speech for the beginning.
:)  A big crowd is a difficult thing to control.
They don't want to sit through a bunch of dry rules.
I need to either write better or write shorter (in this case, maybe they're the same).
Even with the jokes, trying to talk about the various bonuses felt too long.
Next year, I'll try to rework the map to make some of that information available there.
I also need to be able to release them pretty soon after finishing the reading--because the other thing that a large crowd doesn't want to do is wait.
I know that's frustrating.
The end was also a similar sort of difficult-to-manage experience.
While I was really glad to end at a restaurant/bar (which allowed underaged folks, just not for alcohol--very important) because it was a great space to get food and drink without having to manage it ourselves, it also made it difficult to try and direct everyone at once.
This is probably mainly a function of size, and means that the end-of-Journey experience should perhaps become more of a social party, with prizes given individually as people finish rather than trying to have a standalone ceremony.
The board really helped with keeping track of the finishing order, and who was in the running for prizes.
I think that twitter worked pretty well--by having every staff member using twitter for updates, and making sure we all knew each other's twitter, we could follow everyone we needed to and set up our phones for text updates, maintaining very good awareness throughout the night.
Next year, we'll need to make sure that everyone sets up a new account (so that the staff twitter feeds don't leak out beforehand).
We also set up two special feeds, using scripts to collect and retwitter updates--one reposting all checkpoint information, and one reporting all chaser information.
These were to be made available to players during the night.
A few players noticed ahead of time the special feeds--which is fine, and I think clever of them--but once a bunch of people started finding them, I knew I had to block access until the start of the game.
Next year, we'll try to have some more unexpected names so that people won't know without the special bonus.
However, I also really liked the use of journeydc as a \publicity\' pre-game twitter feed and also to provide some more information during the game.'
I think players liked that, and it was pretty cool to have a channel to communicate with (some) players during the game.
On a smaller tactical level, we used a google group for pre-game organizational mailing, and a wiki (running mediawiki) to organize details.
While I think this worked well, and definitely recommend it (it's good to have a central place for files, and automatic records of emails), I think google documents would have worked just as well as (perhaps even better than) the wiki.
I think the new additions worked pretty well.
The bonuses seemed like a good way for people to add another level to the game, finding new layers and depth to the city.
However, it's a terrible feeling to get a bonus that doesn't help you--next year, we should make sure that bonuses aren't duplicated between checkpoints (either through mixup or design).
The bonus checkpoint should have its own unique benefit.
I think the Good Player Fairy was great, both thematically and especially to help prevent chaser camping.
I think it was also important that these additions were optional--that the core of the game has to be the thrill of the chase.
It's a raw theme which appeals directly to our primal instincts, but also makes the game very resilient to any problems.
While I really do like these additions, and think they make the game more interesting, it's important to keep them from dominating the game.
The safe zones worked fairly well for the most part.
Having them be a full block makes for a lot of entrances and exits, which I've come to think is a really good idea.
The two exceptions were Checkpoint 3 (which had only a single section of street), and ended up being a chokepoint for many players, and a killzone for many more.
Also, the safe zone around the bonus area was pretty FUBAR on the map.
It was supposed to be as you see it on the google map, a block around the bonus--but neither the written description nor the map were right, nor were they even the same.
:(  Next year, I'll make sure to have three sets of eyes on the map.
The main issue, I think, is how few people survived to the end.
Many fewer than I was expecting.
I think this was basically because of chaser activity--when we saw how many people there were, we increased the catch limit for staff chasers.
(They were supposed to catch no more than 4 players.
I think this limit should probably be 2 at most.
)  So they ended up catching more players, earlier than expected.
This was a problem because chaser growth is exponential (each chaser can create more than one new chaser by catching players) and the chasers have a pretty one-sided power dynamic with players (if a chaser finds you, there's nothing you can do but run).
I don't think those two things should be changed (it would significantly change the feel of the game)--which means that staff chasers have to be very careful about how many are caught early on.
Also, at least one staff chaser got carried away with the thrill of the chase, and went significantly over their catch limit.
Finally, I think our prizes were really incredible this year.
Dax made some fantastic trophies.
Kprime did an amazing job laser cutting medals, then painting them gold, silver, and bronze for the first places.
The bonus badges and the main player and chaser medals were amazing, and I think having those will make sure that Journey has a special place in every player's hearts and minds.
Final Words

Journey is a great concept--if you can get the word out, that alone will bring in people.
If you already have a group of people who know about it, and are excited about it, and want to bring their friends, it can become a blowout success.
Also--I'll volunteer to answer any questions people have here, about running their own Journeys.
:)  It's a great event, and results in amazing adventure and story.
I'm happy to help anyone else make such a great event happen.
there was a lot of frantic getting ready around 5pm at the house, but after everyone left to go set up at steuart st, the house was very quiet.
two hours later i opened the front gate and walked down the hill into a different world, full of runners and chasers and mischief.
i got to the diner early and the place was pretty dead.
i settled in with a cocktail and agatha christie i'm borrowing from sam.
i fielded some phone calls from chasers and other checkpoint people, talking about when to expect the first player.
when he came in about 30 minutes later, he saw me right away and sat down across from me at the booth, breathing hard, and laid his manifest on the table.
i told him he was first to arrive, signed the paper, and mistakenly sent him off with the wrong clue.
the few other patrons and the owner were kind of curious about this exchange, so i explained the game.
the next person came by shortly after and i gave him the wrong clue, also.
then i had a moment to order breakfast and call sam to ask for the real clue, and got to eat and read and write liner note postcards for a while before players alone and in groups started showing up in close succession with stories and fear and sweat all over them.
by the time the last few stragglers passed by, the eggs on my plate were cold.
i did a task to keep busy and called around again to see how things were progressing beyond my checkpoint.
finally i paid the tab, thanked the owner for being totally cool about troupes of sweaty people running in and out all evening, and went up to catch the n judah to the beach and the bonfire.
hung out there meeting players at more leisure than they had been earlier.
peed in a thicket for the first time ever.
I was an out of control, Scootcarting, world war one pilot looking chaser for the journey, June 17th.
We chased down and wreaked havoc in the lives of many a poor journeying soul.
Preperations
babe: Oktober 17th, early afternoon.
I have Fin on the phone to arrange a time for delivering the trophies I made: golden shoes for fastes runner and chaser and badges for the 5 best of each, runners and chasers.
Made with lÃ¸ve.
proof:30, size:100, align:left
I meet him an hour later at the metalab, heâ??s just back from copying the maps for tonight.
On my way home I buy a bottle of water and a pack of muesli-bars.
Back at home I pack my drink, an extra jacket and gloves.
Itâ??s cold tonight.
suzyzus: While in August I did not really come that well prepared to the first Journey, this time I pack what a good runner needs: bananas, apple juice, bread, chocolate - I did not forsee the greatest aspect of those foods: making friends with fellow runners/total strangers on the public transport.
And off I go to meet the babe, all jumpy and excited.
babe: 6pm: Suzy and I meet up outside my house.
We take the bus down to WerkzeugH where already a croud of people is waiting in the cold.
We pick our maps and ribbons and take a look at the route: 
proof:4, size:100, align:left
First checkpoint Erzherzog -Johann â??Platz.
Not too far.
I start getting a bit nervous.
Fin announces the rules.
People around look at their maps, put their ribbons on and chat.
Itâ??s dark now.
Letâ??s go!
proof:7, size:100, align:left
suzyzus: We decide to run in the opposite direction to the checkpoint in order to avoid being caught early, trying to keep close together and close to the walls of the houses but at the same time to walk as normal as possible to not arouse suspicion.
Every person coming around a corner might be a chaser, paranoia starts to build up.
We hop on a bus that takes us to the Ring, which is safe zone.
Instantly feel better, but not for too long - we need to leave the safe zone to approach the checkpoint.
Paranoia!
babe: When coming nearer to Karlsplatz we already see chasers in the park on the other side of the street.
They didnâ??t recognise us â?? we walk further and try to hide our blue ribbons.
I start getting a bit paranoid.
I turn my head around and look suspiciously on everyone near, trying to make out red ribbons on arms â?? often itâ??s hard to say: Itâ??s dark.
We walk slowly.
This is too much tension for me.
Suddenly Suzy sprints away â?? instinctively I start running as well â?? but taking the other direction.
I look around me: chasers everywhere!
I make it to a niche where I can hide behind a sign.
When taking a look out I see a girl with a route-map in her hand about 5 meters away from me.
I canâ??t see her ribbon but she might be a chaser cause she looks calm.
The sign is hardly big enough to hide me.
In this moment I get really stressed out.
I take out my mobile and call Suzy.
Sheâ??s already on Karlsplatz, hiding somewhere.
I have to follow her.
I take a look out of my hideaway: No chasers in sight anymore.
I sneak out and head direction Karlsplatz.
Itâ??s a park there.
I am nervous as hell.
When I meet Suzy I feel safe again.
Good to see her.
suzyzus: When sprinting away I thought the Babe was right behind me and would hide close by, wrong!
I hide behind a (not-so-easy-but-still) see-through ventilating shaft so I could see the chaser approaching.
She does not see me (or she might have been more focused on a barking and snarling dog that's so excited by all this running and hiding that the owner can barely hold it) and walks past me, while I slowly surround the shaft.
I cross the street and hide near a staircase at the Wien Museum.
Where are you?
There she calls, I whisper in the phone and give her directions.
When she arrives I feel relieved - I would not have wanted to cross the dark dangerous park full of chasers without her.
We walk in direction of the Karlskirche, always keeping close to the dark walls.
I peek around a corner - a chaser!
Phew, he did not see us.
We try the other direction and as i peek around that corner I run into the arms of the same chaser we just avoided.
I try to run as fast as I can, but he eventually gets me.
I ask him what he wants from me, oh a ribbon, what ribbon?
Oh, the blue one, well theeeeeere you go, to give the Babe some time to escape.
I put on the red ribbon - now it's CHASING TIME!
I can run slowly for quite some time but I am not too good at running fast, so what it needs to catch runners is hiding behind cars, sneaking around as quiet as possible and surprise.
I try that but I am already too close to checkpoint 1 and the safe zone.
I walk past it and behind the next corner 3 runners approach me, being chased by some red ribbons.
I runrunrun and make my first catch - YAY!
babe: I realise that Suzy might have got tagged so I sprint back into the park â?? alone.
Suzy is on the phone â?? she said she was chased.
I am on my own.
I am about 500 meters far from the checkpoint.
500 meters full of chasers as it seemed.
But I had no choice anyway.
I decided on doing it quickly.
Someone once told me: When youâ??re feeling unsafe somewhere walk right in the middle of the street, so noone hiding in doors or between parked cars can attack you.
This is exactly what I did: I ran.
I ran as fast as I could and I ran in the middle of the street, shortest way to checkpoint 1.
Not fast enough.
There he was: Chaser!
proof:8, size:100, align:left 
Nice guy actually, but now I was chased, too.
I met Suzy on checkpoint one, now both of us wearing a red ribbon.
proof:9, size:100, align:left
Red ribbons rule!
babe: When leaving the checkpoint I feel much safer.
I kind of like my red ribbon.
Weâ??re heading to checkpoint 2: The Arsenal
suzyzus: We get on the Underground and meet two fellow chasers.
We share some chocolate and get off the train a bit too early.
Maybe we can catch some runners in the backstreets instead?
No luck on that side.
In order to get to checkpoint 2 we have to walk through a dark and kind of scary park.
I am glad that we are chasers now, the suspense would have killed me if I had still been a runner.
We mistake some creepy guys for fellow chasers.
As we approach the checkpoint we meet a guy decorated in blue AND red ribbons, the blue ones dangling off his pants.
Confused we ask him what he is, chaser or runner and he snaps at us, well, what d'ya think!
Obviously he is neither chaser nor runner but rambo, we were able to tell by the red ribbon slung around his forehead, keeping the hair from falling into his eyes.
babe: The two guys hosting the checkpoint were drunk.
Actually the whole checkpoint2-experience was a bit odd what was sad cause the Arsenal is one of my favorite places in the city.
proof:10, size:100, align:left
When we walked on to the next checkpoint we passed the south station.
Two blues were just about to get out of a tram when we scared them in again.
But as soon as we turned around they jumped out, trying to reach the bus on the other side of the street - too slow, we got them.
We took their ribbons and they told us the tram driver wouldn't let them stay in the car cause it was the endpoint of the line.
proof:11, size:100, align:left
I felt bad.
Taking someone out of the game is not a nice thing to do.
Also I liked them.
But at the same time I saw a runner entering the station-building and I felt it: I want him!
I crossed the street and sneaked into the building: there he was, standing in the middle of the hall.
I tagged him, he didnâ??t even run.
Then the discussion: he thought stations were safe.
This was mean, I know, but I took his  ribbon.
I was on the dark side now.
Yellow ribbons!
babe: Obviously players got resurrected somewhere near cause there were people with yellow ribbons coming along.
We decided on scaring them a bit.
We split up, I ran after one, but he was quick.
I was standing on the street and had Suzy on the phone when someone with a yellow ribbon came around the corner on the opposite side of the street.
Obviously he couldnâ??t see my red ribbon wich I wore on my other side.
â??Thereâ??s one comingâ? I said to Suzy.
I watched him.
He was heading in my direction.
Obviously he wanted to cross the street.
I couldnâ??t belive it, he really coming over to me.
I was exited When he was about 5 meters away from me I turned and sprinted his direction.
He ran and made it away.
I hid behind a corner and waited for him coming back.
As he was really coming I attacked again and again he made it away.
I decided on meeting Suzy now and leaving this one but on the other side of the block I saw him again.
I couldnt resist and sneaked between two kiosks.
I jumped out but again he was too quick.
I left to meet Suzy.
Two other chasers came along the street and I said: Therâ??s a yellow one over there â?? heâ??s quick, try your luck.
When turning around a minute later they had him.
This was sad somehow.
I didnâ??t want to be cruel anymore.
proof:15, size:100, align:left
Checkpoints!
babe: From now on we were good again.
We scared the runners a bit but didnâ??t really try to tag them.
Two that already gave up we motivated to go on, a couple of hungry players got some muesli-bars from us in a safe zone and some chasers waiting behind a corner right before the safe zone got some confusing information from us.
We wanted to see the checkpoints.
After the odd Arsenal-experience it was so nice to arrive at Arenbergpark.
There were a couple of people having a nice chat, music was playing and everyone was nice.
Before we came the checkpoint had something like a laser-show, but they ran out of battery - who cares, it was just nice there.
Checkpoint 4 was at the finance ministery complex where they had some antimatter had that had to be handled with care.
proof:17, size:100, align:left
proof:19, size:100, align:left
Checkpoint five was making a movie
proof:22, size:100, align:left
and checkpoint 6 was giving out shots.
Final destination was in quatier 21 in the Museumsquatier-complex.
When we arrived there a croud was alredy waiting, having some drinks and chatting.
We saw a couple of familiar faces again that we met throughout the run.
When winners got announced we saw that the Rambo-guy we met on the 2nd checkpoint, who already there had blue trophy-ribbons hanging off his legs and arms and was wearing his red chaser ribbon on his head really made it to best (or should we say: most cruel) chaser with unbelievable 19 catches!
We loughed a bit and then went on to the bar next door.
In the bar we then saw a group of guys sitting with one of the golden trophy shoes.
we started chatting - Leo, who was the winner together with someone else, really liked the shoe:
proof:31, size:100, align:left
He documented his run here.
It's a nice docu!
Check it out!
Let me begin with a HUGE THANK YOU to all of the Ã?akland Journey organizers - all of this which would not have been possible!
If any of you have noticed, I'm not much of a story-telling-driven-praxis kind of lass, but the only way to properly convey all of which took place last night (especially given my limited photo documenting) is to tell the tale, from beginning to end, using my best possible syntax and diction.
and whatever storytelling powers I can muster!
It Begins.
Mental Preparation
by Deathkitten
\So tell me again how this works?'
where do I start\ I thought to myself
Chasers are players that were caught by other players with red bands.
Sounds easy enough,\ Mauth replied
My adrenaline surged.
First Impressions
by Mauth and Deathkitten
Mauth: This was my first Journey ever.
I was told by Deathkitten and The Animus that this event is the most bad ass thing ever.
I must say that they were correct.
I have never had so much fun walking around the city as I did with this event.
Deathkitten and I traveled together down to the city to rock this out.
All the way down to the city I was being told stories of last years event.
The crew was Deathkitten, Moothebunny, The Animus and insert that name of the guy who left early cause he couldn't handle it.
He shall not be named.
  Players, chasers, it all sounded like so much fun.
I was asked if I thought I would be able to keep up, how fast could I run, was I ready.
Of course I thought I was up for the task.
We were early and had to wait around for things to get rolling.
So to be in tip top condition I thought a bio break was in order, so we walked over to the fountain to use the facilities.
Walking back I was in awe at the number of people that had shown up in such a short amount of time.
When we left there were like 10 people tops waiting, when we came back almost 200.
It was right about then I was getting excited.
Deathkitten: Dax took center stage.
It was nice to see him again.
And what a 'stache!
(side note: It's too bad I wasn't able to give him mad props for it too.
Totally slipped my mind with the whole \run for your life\' thing.'
As Dax went through the ritualistic speech, I took the opportunity to scope out the competition.
\Lots of characters this year
It occured to me that there were many first timers, as was evident by the group sitting behind me wearing very flamboyant attire.
\Are you TRYING to put a target sign on your head?'
Time to get serious.
Need to map it out, need to strategize.
\There are DOUBLE the amount of players than last year!'
\Holy shit.'
I fought my way through the crowd to grab the necessary materials.
It was then, as I struggled to simply grab a map before it was pulled out of my hands, that I got a taste for what this year's game had in store for us.
I forced my way out of the sea of grabbing hands, materials for 2 in hand, and returned to my seat.
Mauth: We got our maps and our bands and now knew what was in store for us.
I was told that a good strategy was to stay in high populated areas when possible, \they will not chase you in high population areas\' I was told.'
I started to think about how to do the night and I was ready to agree with people about that.
Then the time came, we started at the same time as DC started.
Everyone was running, chasers were on bikes in pursuit of the first few people they could pick off.
We got to the Mag Mile and then started to walk, keeping an eye out for chasers and noticing how many blue arm bands were all around us running, jogging or walking fast frantically checking over their shoulders for chasers.
Now I knew how this game was to be played.
I knew that if I was a chaser I would try to ambush people or hide the fact that I was the enemy till it was too late for them to take action.
I thought this is the way the player should be playing as well, keeping a peeled eye out for the chasers but staying calm and collected and looking as normal as possible.
The key was to blend in with the world.
It was the words of Dax that jumped into my head, \You are playing the game in the real world
If you look like a player you get chased as a player, if you look like a NPC, you get ignored.
It was true.
We had many close calls with chasers but because we stayed calm and collected they did not notice our blue bands.
Also, bands had to be placed on the upper arm and needed to be visible.
Our bands were on our upper arm, they were visible, but we made sure to tuck any dangling parts around the band so they were less noticeable from a distance.
This was a great idea because I was able to notice other participants in the game by their loose bands flying in the breeze.
Game Time
Deathkitten: He had a point.
It was a common rule for those involved in animal behavior that \if you act like prey
What elements did the other people on the street have that we were obviously lacking?
I reached out to hold his hand, rested my head on his left arm, and we slowed our pace just slightly.
While every fiber of me was screaming \strength in numbers\'
\If it came down to it
I knew full well that less than half of us would make it through.
But which side would we finish on?
As we were leaving checkpoint 2, the sheer amount of people around me told me we were still at a good pace.
\Do you have a goal for this year?'
\Yes
As long as we set a good pace, we won't be picked off.
The sun was setting.
I was dizzy.
I was out of SHAPE!
\Here's the deal
The response was simple and concise, but I knew more strategies were sinking in.
\There's a Whole Foods.'
We were already ahead of the game, but I was dizzy.
I needed to replenish my fuel (and take a potty break).
\Is it in the safe zone?'
\ he wondered.'
It's gotta be.
In which case, SCORE!
\ I said excitedly.'
 but we found and opening and got to the safe zone.'
We were met by a few other groups of players as well.
In all, there were 3 groups that welcomed us to the checkpoint.
2 of which played around with the idea of taking a bus.
The option was appetizing, but not for us.
We continued to checkpoint 4 on foot.
I could see the look in her eyes, Deathkitten thought I was nuts.
Deathkitten: I THOUGHT HE WAS NUTS!
\Are you INSANE?'
\No
He was solemn, and certain.
He pulled me to the edge of the safe zone.
\Trust me.'
He was right, and I needed to trust his senses as much as he trusted mine.
We've made it this far with our strategy, let's see if we can finish.
In the end I knew that no matter what happened, we would finish together.
The uneasiness settled, we got in character, and we continued on.
Mauth: Deathkitten and I played the entire night this way, we were a couple walking down the street, nothing out of the ordinary and it worked great till we hit check point 4.
All I have to say is holy pink.
Deathkitten took off running, not because she was in pursuit, but because she was all too happy to see a familiar face- this was The Animus' checkpoint.
She lept into his arms, screaming with glee.
It was a good thing too.
Had she not ran, we would have been picked off by the pinks in hiding.
Too many chasers waiting to pick off the prey.
It was a great time to wait for them to get bored and move on and plan our next point.
We lucked out and a bunch of blues ran off in an attempt to break free and a lot of chasers went in pursuit.
We ran out the other way and then quickly jumped back into character when we were out of sight.
We noticed chasers coming from the right so we took a left into a parking lot as though we were a couple getting our car.
They walked by us without thinking twice.
There was no back exit to the lot so we had to double back.
More chasers.
We thought we were boned.
Made it look as though we were just leaving our car, they were too far away to notice the blue and walked by.
Then we saw the chasers on the opposite side of the fence to us, but we walked out of sight unseen.
But we had to go toward them to get to the next point so we got into character, walked to the corner, and crossed the street walking away from them.
We started crossing the other way to beat the light to have traffic between us and them when we think one of them noticed us.
We stayed in character, walked till they were out of sight and booked it for the first shop we could find and walked in.
Although we were technically hiding from the enemy, I thought we should look around.
We both might be making a stop back there to get some things in the future.
When we thought the coast was clear we walked out.
To the right of us there were two chasers.
Deathkitten: \SHIT!'
I should have looked out of the window BEFORE I opened the door.
Any LOGICAL person would have done so!
And now, I've put us in danger.
There, on the other side of the street approaching us, were 2 chasers.
Mauth ducked behind a pillar, but it wasn't going to be big enough for the both of us.
I pleaded with him to come back in, but as the pink ribbons came closer, I ducked back into the shop.
I hid in the back, out of view from the windows.
I was alone.
\Is he ok?'
Mauth was leading us this whole way, his sense of direction is IMPECCABLE.
If we were to get separated, I'd be boned.
I peeked around my make shift hide out, made of bamboo walls and little Buddhas.
There he was, safe and sound, hiding behind the same pillar.
He motioned to me that the coast was clear, his face wore 1 expression: You're a dork.
Mauth: Our bands were on our left arm out of site of them.
Deathkitten almost blew our cover, but they didn't notice as she ran back into the store.
I watched them around a pillar I was able to stay hidden behind until they were far enough down the block to continue.
From this point on we did not break character.
If we saw a chaser we discretely changed direction to walk away from them staying in character the whole time and we ignored them.
Deathkitten: Checkpoint 5 was a breeze.
There were no sign of pinks.
Surely they were still having their fun around checkpoint 4.
This meant we were ahead of the pack of pinks that were at the last checkpoint.
If we could stay ahead of them, we wouldn't have to worry about them hiding out somewhere and chasing us down.
They were together in a group of about 6, we didn't stand a chance if it came down to it.
They would have just herded us.
We took a short break and sat down.
SO CLOSE YET SO FAR!
We weren't sitting down for long before my worst fears came around the corner.
It was the group of pinks, and they were escorting 2 blues!
\THE NERVE!'
He confirmed my anger with a nod.
As the blues in the group got their papers signed, we took the opportunity to make our move.
We slipped past them, got out of sight, and into character for the home stretch.
Mauth: It was at the end that things got really fun, there were several ways into the last safe zone and there were going to be a lot of chasers to deal with for sure.
Fortunately for us we did not encounter many.
There was only one, and he was walking the same direction.
I thought, \we are right there
\ARE YOU CRAZY?'
Then a group turned the corner from the safe zone toward us.
We crossed to the same side of the guy we were following.
Deathkitten's reaction was expected.
\ARE YOU INSANE?'
\IF HE TURNS AROUND
She looked at me in disbelief.
\He'd have to be a complete MORON not to turn around!'
It was a great night with few encounters for us thanks to playing the part of a normal.
Deathkitten: I couldn't believe it.
We stalked a chaser ACROSS THE FINISH LINE!
It was epic.
It deserved an epic finish.
We finished.
We finished TOGETHER.
And here we were, crossing the finish line hand in hand- as we had done for 5 checkpoints before.
\You wanna sprint to the end?'
\ he responded
\ I smiled at him.'
He didn't know if we were checking out the scene, or if we were runners who had crossed the finish line!
We held our cover to the end!
After a \Holy Crap!'
There, displaying proudly, were our numbers- #25/277.
Of the 54 who finished, we finished in the top 50%.
As city kids we have been conditioned never to go to Oakland, to avoid the whole entire city, that death by gang warfare gunfire was most certainly lurking around every corner.
Which is really quite terrible, because as a result of this none of us had even really been to Oakland, meaning we had no knowledge of where to run.
It also made convincing our parents to let us go very difficult.
But plans were made and parents convinced and friends invited and we found ourselves at MacArthur bart station walking over to Mosswood park to gather ribbon and map and eye other players all hoping to make it through to the end of the night.
As we apporached the park we saw Lank walking away looking mighty scary, orange ribbons trailing.
At the start, we looked to Adam to orient and direct us.
He knew the most about Oakland out of the four of us yet he has only lived in the Bay Area two years compared to the nearly two decades each of the rest of us have.
We made it to the first checkpoint easily enough.
We spotted a chaser a couple times ahead up on the hill and followed some groups of players through the backyards of houses, eventually emerging to the rose garden.
I think going fast for the first leg managed to put us ahead of the people who were getting tagged.
Right when we stepped out of the safezone of checkpoint one, we saw people running, so we ran too.
We kept hearing that \chasers are behind us!'
We made it to Checkpoint 2, the lake, after carefully darting across an open grassy area.
Then the real trouble started.
As we were about to leave the safezone around checkpoint 2, a chaser looked at us and said, \I will count to ten
,\ and we ran out across Lakeshore into the hills once more.'
\ and came after us with another chaser.'
\ and he was so close I just yelled
\ completely stunned
\ he yelled out as we passed him.'
Young
We were a large group, larger than expected, and we kept getting bigger.
We eventually got together enough arm bands (after much struggling and strife) For you SFZeroers: I declare that there should be much more supplies-- a lot of people were turned away and it REALLY ruined some people's halloweens.
You could see the tears in their eyes, and it was absolutely awful.
I will personally help set it all up if I have to.
To Checkpoint 1:
We got very very lost.
A third of us were taken out by chasers in the first half hour, but the adredaline rush was like nothing i had ever experienced before: as a former track runner and a current gymnast, I can honestly say that I have experienced no adrenaline rush that lasted that long or made me feel that powerful.
We were running in a group: as a pack of art school geeks with no P.
class, I think we did pretty well.
When we finally got to the first checkpoint, our former teammates (who we thought were chasers because they disappeared, but then turned out they were tagged in the safe zone) gave us the map, and we checked off number one, then took a break to eat candy and drink water.
Yay for choco-calories!
To Checkpoint 2:
With our team a few down, we began to run to the next checkpoint: we tried to be very careful, however we lost a few more to chasers as we hurdled down stillman with a second team, inching towards the HOUSE checkpoint.
Our former teammates were there, so the runner half of us went in to sign off: we had a huddle/powow afterwards.
Hooting and screaming and howling: we were formidable.
To Checkpoint 3:
We were attacked by some chasers down by checkpoint three, so we hid in the safezone and only two of us went into the third checkpoint: bryce recieved a bell, and alex recieved the tie.
To Checkpoint 4:
After this point, we decided that we'd play it up a little: the runners stayed in front of the chasers in order to create an air of safety, and would run for checkpoint 4 when they saw another group of runners: at one point, we ran into a group of chasers and charged after them.
Later, the runners at the checkpoint: Alex, Bryce, and I, heard a guy talk about \a mob of chasers attack his team and completely destroy it\'.'
We laughed.
it was us.
I didn't go into checkpoint 4: but it involved going into a darkroom and popping balloons to find the next object necessary to continue.
Alex, who DID go inside the checkpoint, gave me the update on what happened exactly:
Alex: 
i waited for about 20 minutes before i got to go in.
when we went in, we had to use flashlights.
In the dark room there was a netted in area with about 50-75 balloons.
they were being blown around by a fan.
we had to find a certain symbol that looked like a circle with 2 very short tails coming out of it.
once we found one each, we showed the lady our bells and pipe line from the previouse checkpoint and our map with the 3 signatures.
the person then stamped the unusual symbol on the area that proved that we have been to the 4th check point.
We then left and ran into the crew.
After checkpoint 4
after checkpoint 4 it was eleven o'clock and I could stay out no later.
Most people began to go home, and I left with Karen and Elsa.
We bought burritoes and sauntered over to my house where we collapsed in a rice-and-beans exhaustion from the run.
necromants, burnt out traditional music stars, laser-graphitti, scientists saving the world, .
i don't really think my praxis is worth reading, let alone voting for.
i did Journey, but not with any style or panache.
go read LincÃ¸ln's praxis.
This was my first JttEotN.
I can't wait for the next one!
I will use my new knowledge to play at full force!
Mostly i was a chaser, and i caught 6 people.
#2 was a slow-moving friend of #1, 
#s 4 and 5 were steadfast allies of #3 who turned their bands over to me willingly rather than break up the friendship, 
and #6 fell into my lap on the 71.
i played it cool and put my body between her and my armband until she and her cadre exited the bus.
they were already set to run from a recently-turned friend of theirs, but i caught her nonetheless.
It was neat to be at full-alert when running from people, and i liked seeing the city in a strategic way.
the grove was beautiful with glow sticks, and I met Sean.
he was nice.
the rest of this- skip it.
seriously, don't waste your time.
it's all just stupid emotional stuff and how i did a bad job.
it's catharsis, not useful history.
that's another thing, i stress about doing a bad job too much when i should be making something great happen.
C'mon, Saturday, how do you really feel?
i feel like i missed all the fun, because i am dumb.
i didn't know about the checkpoint challenges, so when i was tagged before the second checkpoint (seriously?
not even the second checkpoint?
)(yeah, a clown and i had a miscommunication.
)  i didn't bother going to any checkpoints.
also i thought that runners would be alert to chasers between checkpoints, so i mostly skirted a block or so around the safezones and ran into approximately nobody.
the end result was that i walked about 6 miles without seeing more than 20 people involved in the game.
i spent about 7 hours skulking around San Francisco, looking nonchalant when people complimented my costume.
that was another thing.
i am totally chalant!
i felt like i was half-in a character who was urbane and genteel, and so i couldn't access my natural effervescence, warmth and charm.
the interactions i had were awkward and brief.
i also had increasingly distracting discomfort in my hip joints.
am i 70 now?
so when i couldn't find any players i decided that they were all just further ahead than me, and i'd go to the end point and work backwards.
except by the time i was there it was getting harder and harder to ignore my hips, i had only one checkpoint stamp and 6 ribbons, and i felt pretty heavily bummed out.
i met Sean at the refreshment tables.
he said \oh
around then Rubin called, and that helped.
i really like that guy.
Corpus Callosum was playing, and i waltzed with their flyer girl, and started to feel better.
I'm in a lovely garden surrounded by adventurers, i thought.
how bad can it be?
it was about midnight by then, and i had been led by the internet to believe that buses stopped running after 12:30, so if i didn't get back to my car at start point by then i would be walking.
walking by this point was bad.
it seemed like an ok time to leave, as there weren't many people there and i had heard the party would go until 6am.
so i caught a bus back to my car, had a nice conversation with Rubin, and spent like an hour getting across the city.
navigation fail, plus SF doesn't believe in gas stations north of 15th.
i finally got back to the park, excited about the large size to which the party had inevitably grown, excited about meeting LincÃ¸ln and Artmouse, excited about visiting with Corpus Callosum, in time to see the last of the clean-up crew snuggling into their cars to go home.
I wasn't sure that was what they were, so i went to the garden, which was dark and tidy, and wandered aimlessly for a few minutes in case there was an after-afterparty-party somewhere nearby.
Sean finally took pity on me and told me it was done.
i said nothing interesting or useful, and headed home.
so i had about 20 min.
of heightened awareness, navigation, and being chased, about 5 combined min.
of chasing, about 20 minutes of interesting party, and the other 6.
25 hrs peering at people's upper arms, forgetting directions, and trying to ignore my joints.
part of it was just bad timing.
i missed hearing about the challenges, i missed the mass of players,  i missed everybody i was hoping to meet at the party.
i even missed the starting gun because i was getting change for the bus.
i was just out of sync.
but part of it is exactly the kind of thing that makes me think i don't belong at SF0, i am just extremely lame and should go watch television and wait for death instead of irritating interesting people with my noise.
you get as much fun out of something as you bring to it, and i just failed to bring it.
plus my choices are bad.
i overthink things, causing me to try to fool the runners by not being where they are, and therefore seeing none of them.
i flew solo, instead of cooperating with people.
how can a person suck so much fun out of something so awesome?
Is it talent, or finely honed skill?
I was pretty disappointed.
not in the game, which obviously is great and amazing, but in myself.
the high point of my game was Rubin telling me that Ink Tea's Halloween costume was Sexy Abraham Lincoln.
but today i played music at an art show where i had a couple pieces, and then Dax and J.
and I were a rhizome, and we invented a new way to dance or do math or both.
then we created a balloon orchestra.
we all told funny jokes and laughed and everything was nice.
i love that kind of physical/aesthetic explorative play, and i feel happy tonight.
tonight i do not feel like a total loser.
Next Journey i will come as myself, and i will do all the checkpoints, and i will have a better time than i had this Journey.
Seriously, I didn't have a good time at Journey to the End of the Night?
And i call myself human?
This is an adventure.
We gathered in Griffith Park.
We met old and new friends.
Lincoln told us the rules.
And so it began.
Nazzo - Before
The paranoia sets in immediately.
Slowing to a walk as the mad dash away from Griffith Park ends, Theresa (a non-player), Lefthandedsnail, and I are absolutely certain every man walking a dog, smoking a cigarette, or sitting on a wall are chasers just waiting for us to get too close before springing upon us in a splatter of gore.
No gore ensues.
To ensure that the gore levels remain the same, we take side streets and carefully avoid traveling straight down Western, or remaining on Franklin for long.
We decide to head for the White Horse bonus checkpoint, since it's basically on the way to the first checkpoint, and approach from the south to avoid any chasers watching the obvious direction.
Upon arrival, we find not chaser guardians, but a group of eight or nine other runners who direct us to the bouncer for manifest signing.
The Walrus asks to run with my group, but when we leave for the Red Line station, she stays behind.
I wish I could say this was the last time I saw her alive, but in the end, she beats me to the last checkpoint.
Fiddlesticks.
Our plan is simple: take the Red Line to Hollywood and Vine, then hop back on and take it to Hollywood and Highland, since the exit there is in a safe zone.
No plan survives first contact with the enemy, however incompetent or unprepared that enemy may appear at first glance.
My first contact with the enemy came at the top of the escalator up from the trains at the Hollywood and Vine Station, Lord Bojangles Winston-Jones walking a bicycle just ten feet ahead of me towards the station exit.
I leapt behind a large railmap, and frantically motioned for Theresa and Lefthandedsnail to join me.
I quickly let them know what's going on, and then we ghost after him a few yards behind.
He stops to wait for the elevator to the surface, and we cluster in the lee of an open door, darting quick glances at him as he waits.
As soon as he steps inside, we sprint up the stairs, and Theresa and I are out the mouth of the station in a few seconds.
We turn to look for Lefthandedsnail, but she's nowhere to be seen.
We retreat to a safe distance away from the station, at the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, and nervously watch the exit of the station, unsure of what's going on.
A few seconds later, Bojangles comes out of the station, mounts his bicycle, and heads in the opposite direction.
We keep watching, and soon after, Lefthandedsnail emerges.
We wave and yell to her, and then snicker over our close call.
Apparently, after falling behind, she had decided to wait for him to pass her, then follow behind.
It worked.
We keep moving north, just two blocks away from the first checkpoint.
Unfortunately, it seems Bojangles had decided to prowl the surrounding area, instead of heading out to lurk near the checkpoint.
He rolls out of a parking lot on our right, straight for us.
I dive between two staggered rows of parked cars, and Theresa and Lefthandedsnail scatter in different directions.
I zigzag through the lot, trying to stay where his bicycle can't reach, but soon realize he isn't following.
He knows which way I went, however, so as soon as I'm out of the lot, I hustle towards the first checkpoint's safe zone.
As I round the corner onto Yucca, I spot Lefthandedsnail approaching from the opposite direction.
We meet up and cross the street to the waving robot standing in the middle of an island, then stop to rest.
There's no sign of Theresa or Bojangles, but there's also no time to mourn the lost.
After getting our manifests signed by Lowteck, we head west, deciding to make a beeline for the Chinese Theater instead of trying to get back to the Red Line.
Unfortunately, Bojangles had the same idea.
Within five minutes, a look over my shoulder found him quickly bearing down on us.
We couldn't outrun him, so we dive into the parking lot of a small apartment complex, hoping for a side exit.
I sprint for an alley at the back of the lot, looking.
There is no exit.
I duck into a laundry room, and briefly open a dryer before realizing I outgrew hiding in them approximately one decade ago.
Instead, I jump up on the sink next to the doorway and flatten myself against the wall, hoping a brief look inside won't find me.
I'm lucky.
He doesn't look.
After a few minutes, I pull out my phone and call Lefthandedsnail.
She answers:
â??Hey there, enemy.
â?
â??I got away.
â?
â??Well, see you out there.
â?
â??Good luck.
â?
Hoping she fell for it, I sneak out of the laundry room and loop around back, where I find a door to the street marked EXIT I hadn't seen before.
I try at it for a while, but it's locked and won't give.
I come back and listen for Bojangles and Lefthandedsnail from around a corner, and hear voices, but after a minute decide they're from the tenants and leave.
I get to the exit and look out at the street, and see Bojangles at the corner of Yucca and Cahuenga.
I duck back and check back every few seconds until I see he's crossed the street, and then head out.
He's almost immediately on top of me.
He turns back, and rides straight at me.
I dodge into the street, double around a van and bolt in the direction he came from across the parking lot of the 7-11, then sprint half a block and duck into the parking lot of a dingy motel after checking back to see if I'm followed.
I take the break to check my map and decide on a new route, and after a few minutes of waiting, decide he probably isn't following.
I trudge to the Chinese Theater along Franklin and circle around behind to come at it from the west.
Garnett - Before
After Lincoln had given the go-ahead, I began the game with the large group, headed up by Jake the Snake (a curly-haired non-player (or as Sturm und Drang would later put it, as-YET-non-player)).
Our plan was to take a needlessly circuitous route through residential property to the bonus checkpoint at the White Horse, and from thence to the first checkpoint.
Of course, we immediately freak out when we see some guy walking towards us on Los Feliz, cutting short our plans to take Laughlin Park (which I continuously mispronounce Vitamin Park because the map is illegible) down to the proper latitude.
No matter!
We used our maps and improvised, and I sang Safety Dance as we went.
Jake kept hearing bicycles, which led to us talking about how saying 'Chaser' is like saying 'Voldemort', which led to me kvetching about Harry Potter spoilers.
On the way, we met a friendly Asian woman with a cat who said hello and asked us how we were doing.
We responded with appropriate deference and cheer.
Then we crossed the street.
Then we crossed the street again, because I am bad at knowing what side of the street things are on.
Finally, we reached the checkpoint.
I asked some guys on the sidewalk if they knew anything about Journey.
They didn't.
The bouncer did, though.
Signatures in hand (except for me because I forgot) we headed through more residential streets, splitting up into a large group, and a small commando team of Edison, Jake, and myself.
Our plan was to cut across the freeway at Carlton Way.
That didn't work out (mainly because Carlton Way doesn't cross the freeway), so we used Hollywood instead.
On the way, we made a quick stop for water and cashews.
but I soon passed on those cashews to a panhandler who seemed to be listening to his iPod.
I don't claim to understand the universe.
I just live there!
Heading up Argyle to the first checkpoint, we meet up with our group and post watches in all directions.
We arrive.
Once there, several things happen:
I get my manifest signed.
I steal Pamda's identity (her bank card and state license) unwittingly.
I learn that Nazzo, my future compatriot, is the only one of his group surviving.
The Mark II refers to him as the 'human with human teeth around his neck'.
I politely correct him, noting that they are orc teeth.
Our group decides to go back down Argyle and walk Hollywood to the next checkpoint.
That last resolution doesn't last long, since as soon as we are halfway down the block we see a biker coming our way, yell 'it's Mackinney!
' in girly voices in reference to Bojangles's mild-mannered alter ego, and run screaming in the opposite direction.
This means we end up taking Vine down to Hollywood, at which point everyone but Jake decides to take the train after all, since it opens into a safe zone.
Meanwhile, Jake leaves to go by foot.
We cross the street, head to the Subway entrance, and as we are getting up parallel to it, someone yells 'RUN!
Oh boy did we ever.
Of course, there wasn't actually anyone there.
But how were we to know that?
:)
Once underground, I tried to buy tickets for the other runners.
However, I unknowingly used Pamda's previously-mentioned bank card instead of my own, so it didn't work and another runner had to buy me a ticket instead.
We took the Red Line, and eventually emerged near Mann's.
only to be tagged by Bicycle Bojangles, who tells us he's 'pretty sure' that the second checkpoint is the El Capitan.
After being corrected on this fact, he apologizes, declares us 'free to go', and disappears into the night.
We make our way towards Mann's, admiring what seems to be California's Harajuku.
Finally, we found Captain Barbapoca (Tom O' Tillo for all you newhats out there), who was eager to hand out signatures, assuage our fears about using the mall on this block, and point us in the direction of a coffee shop.
It was at this coffee shop that I met up with the runner who would be my companion for the majority of the Journey.
Together(Nazzo in cyan, Garnett in blue)
I soon find myself at a McDonald's nearby, looking for a quick snack to keep me going for the rest of the journey.
Unfortunately, after waiting in line for five minutes, I realize my wallet is in Theresa's pack, and contrary to my affirmation to Barbapoca that I wouldn't be buying her dinner tonight, I end up buying her dinner tonight.
I'm introduced to Sturm und Drang, and we have a pleasant pile of sandwiches and smoothies.
This is where I come in.
The large group with whom I was travelling had split up for pit stops and strategizing, and I meanwhile had high-tailed it to the aforementioned cafe, where I find my good friend Nazzo fraternizing with the enemy.
I meet up with Garnett at the cafe, and he orders a pile of food for his runner group (finding out in the process that I had nabbed Pamda's bank card, which happens to look identical to my own save for the name and number).
Unfortunately, the intended recipients of my three smoothies, three muffins, croissant and water are nowhere to be found - they had left the rendezvous point outside the mall where they said we'd meet up.
We try to call them, and look all around the vicinity, but when we find Tac, Cheerio, the Reverend, and Black Coyote leaving, decide it's time to hightail it out, and split the spoils among ourselves.
We leave separately, Garnett and I heading south on Orange to avoid any chasers lurking around the eastern edge of the safezone.
Theresa and Sturm und Drang don't follow.
I can only assume smoothies took precedence over victory.
Our initial plan from that point onward is to take a bus down Highland, but a quick conversation with a bus driver on his layover break show that this probably won't work.
So instead, we head down Hollywood on foot, keeping a good lookout for anyone who isn't us.
We soon meet up with Tac and his band for a second time, and talk about our immediate plans (whether or not to go to the southmost bonus checkpoint) and Jake's current alignment (Tac believes he saw Jake with a red armband, and that a later bizarre phone conversation confirmed this).
We decide to split up to avoid being a big target, and we bid Cheerio andal goodbye as they branch off to the left.
I quickly discover that I've somehow lost my sense of direction, and I soon find myself asking Nazzo if he's sure we're headed south.
And again.
And again.
My fears assuaged, we continue, and finally arrive at Santa Monica Boulevard.
One long street down, one to go!
Turns out the one to go is longer.
Much longer.
We keep looking over our shoulders to try to catch a bus, but none pass, and we trudge all the way to Santa Monica and Gordon without event.
I turn back on my camera and manage to get about five minutes' footage, starting with a shot of Nazzo looking suave.
(He is not wearing his hat as I am using it to carry the remaining bakery goods.
)
At Checkpoint Three we're met by a zombie who doesn't seem to know what's going on, and decide to keep moving as soon as we can.
As soon as we can doesn't mean as fast as we can, though, and we're utterly exhausted and footsore at this point.
(At least I am.
)  We take a seat at the nearest bus stop.
Nazzo uses the wall, but I have other plans.
While waiting, we are intercepted by one of the most frightening chasers I've ever seen, at a speed that would make Bicycle Bojangles turn his head.
He tags me and dances around the barrier with Nazzo for some time, but we are finally able to convince him that the entire block, up to the next big intersection, is in fact a safe zone, as per Barbapoca's advice.
Foiled and thoroughly miffed, the Chaser departs, and soon enough our bus arrives, disgorging the large runner group, who seem to be hot on our heels.
The bus driver is a kindly woman, putting up with me finding change to pay the toll.
On our way, she asks about all the odd people who seem to be out and about on this street.
We give her the cliffs-notes summary, that it is a scavenger hunt and the zombies near the graveyard are simply officials in this matter.
She proceeds to pass this information on to unknown friends via a hands-free cell phone, as we search for a good place to get off the bus and continue towards the fourth checkpoint.
And here I was thinking she was just a bit off in the head.
Hands-free, right!
When we do so, I stop to get cash, and in the process realize that I've left my manifest on the bus, which has already receded from view.
I curse inwardly, but do not let the calamity affect my drive.
If I cannot claim the spoils of victory as a runner, I can at least act as a loyal bodyguard to Nazzo and see him through to the end!
which we aren't even near, of course.
Even though we're fairly close to Checkpoints Five and Six, it's still a few blocks up Edgemont to Checkpoint Four.
We start walking, skirting a block east to avoid the Edgemont/Santa Monica intersection, and spend a long trudge doing nothing but looking over our shoulder expecting a bicycle every few minutes.
We eventually end up on Edgemont notwithstanding, and walk past the Scientologist temple on Sunset, as well as the enormous Kaiser Hospital.
Finally, after a long stretch of paranoia, we arrive at Hollywood Boulevard, and prepare to enter Barnsdall Park.
Which is at the top of a hill.
Spongemonkeys.
So we scale that hill.
And we sing a silly marching song that my mom taught me.
And we get to the top and can't find anyone there, a problem exacerbated by the fact that we never asked the checkpoint zombie who we were supposed to find here.
After fruitlessly asking some passers-by whether they had seen 'anyone who looks weirder than us', I go to take a pit stop and Nazzo calls one of his still-living associates, who reveals that the checkpoint master is a fairy.
While Garnett is in the restroom, I ask theater-goers if they've seen any diminutive womens with wings about.
None have.
I inform Garnett of our quandary.
In a last ditch effort, I clap my hands wildly, and shout.
'I DO BELIEVE IN FAIRIES!
I DO BELIEVE IN FAIRIES!
I DO I DO I DO!
'
And we hear clapping in response, which leads us to the checkpoint proper, as guarded by River, Lincoln and River's father (whom we mistake for Lowteck, assuming he had come here after going off-duty).
They congratulate us on being the first to the checkpoint (again!
) and I confess to having lost my manifest.
Lincoln gives me a disapproving look, and asks if I am, then, serving as a decoy.
I answer, 'I am now,' taking Nazzo's patent-felt fedora and in the process becoming probably the most conspicuous runner still in the game.
On our way out, we examine Nazzo's map to determine the safest route.
We decide whilst cutting across a parking lot to stop at the Vermont/Hollywood Rite-Aid and refill the camera's batteries.
Once out, we quickly scout around the area to be sure that there are still no chasers nearby before continuing.
That's when Nazzo realizes his manifest is missing, too.
And while he backtracks into the Rite-Aid to look around and I scour the parking lot, disaster strikes.
I am tagged.
Nazzo escapes.
I run harder than I've run in a long time.
Rite Aid is not out there on its own with its handy parking lot.
It's part of a huge strip mall.
It's on the end of a huge strip mall.
I'm running for the next corner, which is at the other end of the huge strip mall.
By the time I reach the corner, Jake has fallen behind, but I hear another chaser after me, and dive around the corner, hoping for some hiding place to pop out at me.
The walls on either side of the street are pretty flat, and I see no alleys.
I dive into the street, and lay down behind a car, still clutching the wallet I had been looking for my manifest in as I inch further and further into the street so they won't see my legs when they pass on the sidewalk.
As I hear them catch up, I'm sure they'll hear my keys jingling or my panting, but I only hear Sturm telling Jake that I was here a moment ago.
I take Jake's 'THAT MEANS HE'S STILL HERE!
' as my signal, and bolt across the street to a door propped open by a caution cone.
I dive in, spin, kick the caution cone into the street, and slam the door shut in Sturm's face.
I fly down the steps, not sure if the door locks or not, and hide under the bottom flight to catch my breath and make one more futile search through my pockets for my manifest.
Maybe I stuffed it down my pants by mistake and it's stuck to my sweaty underwear?
It's not.
I realize I'm missing something else.
Garnett has my hat.
Meanwhile, I have caught up to the group of chasers that tagged me, and one of them (the very Jake who led my first group that night) is talking to Nazzo on his telephone, telling him that he will be arrested unless he gives himself up.
I am handed the phone in order to deal with the lack-of-manifest issue, and I make my motives clear to everyone: I will find the map, return it to my friend, and then turn.
The chasers are amicable to this, and I return to the Rite-Aid parking lot forlornely picking up scrap paper in the vain hopes of finding the one I seek.
Arrested?
I'm going to be arrested?
Jake seems to be sure I'm on the third floor, I CAN HEAR YOU STOMPING UP THERE, and informs me that the building is surrounded.
I take this in mind, and continue walking south, turning around my second corner from the building and preparing to loop back to look for my manifest.
On my way back, I see Theresa, Jake, and Sturm walking away from the building, and call to taunt them a little bit.
I also pass the large group of runners, and tell them to find a different path, as there are chasers where I'm coming from.
I later find out that when explained what the game was, one of the security guards had told the chaser group that I was on the third floor, whether or not he actually had any evidence of that will never be known.
One interesting thing, though, is that I was never on the third floor.
Seeing Nazzo arrive, I turn, and we retrace our steps back to the last point at which we knew we had the manifest, to no effect.
Finally, Nazzo suggests that I look in my backpack, and, wonder of wonders, there it is below half a foot of detritus.
I hand it to him, pick up my ribbon, and tell him, 'You have until I put this on.
'  I run.
With my hat.
And then I changed.
Garnett - After
Meeting up with the chaser group again (Sturm und Drang, Jake, and Theresa, I believe) I inform them of Nazzo's escape - of which it seems Jake has already learned.
We hop on a train to the fifth checkpoint, meeting up with Bojangles and swapping information on the remaining runners on the way.
Once there, we spend some time taunting the runners through a fence (giving me a chance to return Pam's identity to her).
Realizing that many of the runners are already there, we decide get ahead of them by spliting up and posting guards around the final stop of the night.
We encounter Waldo Cheerio along our way, who jumps out at us before he realizes we are on the same team.
He returns to his hiding spot, and we finally arrive at the hole-in-the-wall location of the finish line, staking out the surrounding streets.
Suspecting from our earlier modus operandi that Nazzo will take backways to reach the end, I stake out the south side of the block, hiding behind a parking lot divider and waiting for the first runners to arrive.
Nazzo - After
I run.
Well, more of a jog, really.
I'm pretty tired by this point.
I slow to a walk when I reach Vermont and Hollywood, and keep a weary eye out for any chasers.
I could take some side street to avoid the major intersection, but that would involve heading back and passing Garnett.
I head east on Hollywood to Virgil, and take that south to Sunset to approach Checkpoint Four from the east.
I despair for a moment, realizing it's on the other side of the street from me and I'll have to make a run for it, but I see no chasers around, and none tackle me a I sprint across the crosswalk to find safe haven at El Gran Burrito.
For once, I'm not the first there.
The large runner group I'd run into earlier was already there, having head straight down Vermont.
I feel pretty dumb by that point.
Side streets seem to have gotten me nothing but Bojangles on wheels, Jake the Snake, and despair.
I sit down for a few minutes and take a rest.
While waiting, the place becomes surrounded by chasers, and I begin to worry about leaving.
I meet up with Edison Small, and we decide to head out before the other runners do.
We first try the back exit, but Black Coyote is there.
We then scope out the street, but decide that Bojangles is probably lurking out there somewhere.
When I encounter Loki, I don't realize until the second or third time I've passed him looking for a way out that I haven't had my manifest signed, and offer it.
Our last option is the Red Line, and we lurk about it for a while trying to decide between actually taking it or just going through to the other end of the station on the opposite side of the street.
Eventually, we take it down to Vermont/Beverly, and then get off to approach along Heliotrope from the south.
When we exit the station, we're not sure which way west is, so we head along Beverly for a couple blocks until an elderly Hispanic gentleman confirms that Melrose is north of us.
We find Heliotrope, and walk along.
After a couple blocks, we see a large crowd on the sidewalk, and assume it's the line for a club, not realizing we've reached Melrose.
We actually end up just across the street before the sight of Garnett lurking in the parking lot and his cry to 'get them' alert us that we may have reached the checkpoint.
I dodge around a car, onto the sidewalk, then around the other side when Garnett informs me by his silence that I am indeed NOT safe, and dash into the safe zone.
Surprisingly, unlike my other three traveling companions, Small also makes it.
Reactions
This was an incredible experience.
Exploring the city with friends, running wildly, entertainment through interaction with the real universe.
Even though I was probably the most forgetful/disorganized person there (forgetting a bonus signature, losing my manifest, andc andal) I still had tons of fun, both as a runner and as a chaser.
The chaser part was particularly interesting: having all of my knowledge of the first part of the game, of my past alliances and trials and successes, and yet suddenly viewing these memories from totally different objectives, along a totally different trajectory of desire.
I kept thinking to myself, 'this must be how vampires feel all the time'.
All in all, a fantastic night.
I can't wait for the next one.
Mission accomplished.
This night was what living should be about all the time, using your wits and eating a sandwich.
It was a difficult and important decision over which I agonized for some time.
Journey to the End of the Night was coming to DC, and I had a choice: do I run, do I chase, or do I make large quantities of Jello?
I chose Jello.
But, let me back up a bit.
I had heard such great things about past JttEotNs, and given the opportunity to participate I simply HAD to be involved.
I have never been much of a runner, but I probably could've scared a few players as a chaser since I do have a talent for invisibility.
On the other hand, working a checkpoint would be open to considerable creativity, and I do so love being in costume.
I asked myself who would be friendly and approachable and yet most people probably wouldn't approach them?
Mormon missionaries, that's who.
And thus the Mormon-themed checkpoint was born.
But whence the jello?
In 2001, Utah made Jell-O the official snack food of the state.
Therefore, no Mormon-themed checkpoint could be complete without copious amounts of the jiggly goo.
But I knew that I obviously wouldn't have a fridge available and that the quantities I would be making wouldn't even fit in my fridge (apparently, my roommates like to keep actual food in there.
The nerve!
), so a search for a jello-like product that wouldn't melt if left out for an entire day began.
Clearly, this was meant to be because before I could even tell anyone about my search, my sister emailed.
'In unrelated news.
I have a source for vegetarian Jello that jells at room temperature, according to the box.
Yellow (Mango), Green (Banana) and maybe some other colors.
They sell it at Sizar's Market in Columbia.
There ought to be some creative uses for something like that, don't you think?
'
This will henceforth be referred to as The Miracle of the Jello.
Well, technically, 'Jelly'.
'Jelly' is a product of Pakistan that comes in many exciting flavors (including mango, banana, apple, and lychee!
) and is vegetarian-friendly and halal.
The ingredients list is basically the same as jello, but with 'vegetable gum' instead of gelatin.
It is amazing.
It does, indeed, set at room temperature and it definitely does not melt--it closely resembles the texture of gummi bears, in fact.
I drove 20 miles and bought nine boxes for about the same price as official Jell-O--and the clerk didn't even look at me funny.
Most of it came out great, but I lost one whole batch when I poured in the boiling water and dead spiders floated to the top.
That left me scrounging around for something else to make up for it and I ended up with a whole lot of half-jelly/half-gelatin cups that never did quite set.
My companion, Sister Despain, and I donned our makeshift nametags, grabed our box o' jello and a couple jugs of water and headed down to Washington Circle to set up checkpoint 1.
The main things I learned were that checkpoint 1 is BUSY--we barely had any time to sing Mormon children's songs--and that if I am ever asked to chalk out an entire traffic circle again I will make sure to wear clothing that is more conducive to crawling along the ground (instead of repeatedly standing and squatting) and/or I will find a way to attach chalk to some sort of pole or something.
Less than one hour and more than 195 people later, more than 20 minutes went by without a runner so we packed up and headed to HQ.
We had some jello and water leftover so we gave it to a nice homeless man who had been keeping an eye on the creepy homeless man that was circling us like a vulture for most of the night.
Norval and I made it through at 7 checkpoints, finishing 11th at 11:20PM.
The checkpoints were great, though the Clue game took a while to figure out how to record our facts on the sheet.
Octavia and Haight/Divis checkpoints were the worst in terms of chasers, with every entrance/exit filled with milling chasers.
We got separated both entering and existing Octavia due to chasers but never got touched.
We actually had to run into traffic to avoid the chasers at Divis.
The only way we made it to the last checkpoint was to take public transit directly from checkpoint to checkpoint:
24 Divis at Haight (safezone)
transfer at 18th (the Castro was crazy, but no chasers)
33 Stanyan at Valencia (safezone)
I recorded our run using Nike+:

sitesrc=fbk_ab_plus
You can see my speed spike from a 60 min/mile to a 5 min/mile as we were chased.
Checkpoint 2
The Couple
There was time when I thought we wouldn't be participating.
My lady friend was not keen on the idea of chasing or being chased by strangers through the city (she's a level headed, reasonable type).
It was a perfect compromise, suggested by Agent Kellogg, that we man one of the checkpoints.
We arrived early and picked up our Top Secret Info Sheet, and then we hoofed it to the checkpoint.
proof:1, size:100, align:left
We settled on one of the benches beneath the Old Chinese Hospital, as it was too nice to stay in doors my lady friend, ever the forward thinker, felt it would not be a good idea to have people running into the hospital waiting room.
proof:2, size:100, align:left
We knew we were going to be identified as 'The Couple', so we sat close, had one pair of headphones that we each shared (listening to This American Life), signed manifests jointly, and tried to finish each others sentences.
This ended up being much easier than we anticipated.
proof:3, size:100, align:left
Speedy Spotlight was the first to our checkpoint, a few minutes ahead of Edward.
He seemed pretty humble about his amazing speed, but both him and Edward deserve mad props.
Shortly after the other groups arrived in hordes.
proof:4, size:100, align:left
Some standouts:
The young lady dressed as a bum, with a fake beard.
She walked by us, ditched her costume and then ran back for a signature.
I didn't even recognize it, but Al noticed that the shoes were the same.
The young man who told the story of locking himself in a maintenance closet to avoid a tagging
Tom Drake and Karrin, noble birthday boy and companion, who allowed us too cut their ribbons in half to tag two latecomers who missed the starting gun.
I almost felt bad about directing them straight towards Orion and his chasers.
After the rush wound down, we made our way to the Presidio to see Prank Monkey at his Whiskey-Soaked Checkpoint.
As we were heading to the Endpoint, we walked under the palace of fine arts domeâ?¦ when we went under, three chasers came out of the shadows like some street gang in the Warriors.
I think they were disappointed we were not runners.
Finally to the Wave Organ for a lovely little after party, and then some well deserved rest.
What a day.
Team Asylum Plan takes on the Journey to the End of the Night
I heard about this madness several weeks ago, from my good friend Reed.
Never being one to turn down an adventure (and certainly not one of such epic proportions), I told him I would be thrilled to join him.
Being me (and Reed being Reed) the two of us wound up being the team leaders of a veritable army of runners.
We gathered at Reed's house near Rockridge to plan (and eat dinner) beforehand.
Of course, with things being as they were, a solid half of our adventurers failed to show up, for various (mostly unexplained) reasons.
Our initial team was thus myself, Reed, Nichoel, Greg, and Ben Gould.
After Reed fried some pasta for dinner (why did he fry pasta?
\Because it's TASTY!'
We were a pretty solid adventuring party, and fairly well-equipped.
In addition to the expected water bottles and cool-looking clothing, we had between us a walking staff, a large coiled spring, a video camera (the footage from which I will hopefully upload later), a bag of pastries, and half a baguette.
Upon arrival, we ran into two more compatriots, Savage and Polin, and rather hastily and arbitrarily settled on the name of Team Asylum Plan, beating out Team Not On Fire and Team Danger Penguins.
We recognized various other people at the starting point, such as Con Jesus and an old acquaintance of mine from my aikido days.
Our start went smoothly enough, sticking to side roads.
until we started to see the bike-chasers.
This was all sorts of worrisome.
Just short of one of the big roads, we saw a bike-chaser go whizzing past, and ran back down the way we'd come.
Unfortunately, we ran into a group who informed us that the other end of the road now ALSO had a bike-chaser.
The other chaser came back, and we suddenly found ourselves trapped.
With a start, Polin realized our friend Vivi lived on this block.
So we all made a mad dash and pounded on her door to let us in.
We collapsed in the door the moment she opened it, and slammed it behind us, just in time.
We watched half a dozen runners flee down the street outside, with the bike chaser hot on their heels.
Vivi gave us all very strange looks, especially when Savage asked if she happened to have a red umbrella in the house.
With the confirmation that yes, she did have one, and no, she would not take it out and join us (as this would've been against the spirit of the game, come on, team!
) we set back out again.
We ran into another group about our size, and joined up with them briefly.
Ben Gould split off from the main team as we got closer to the first checkpoint.
Our system of having one person scouting around each corner seemed to be working well enough for the moment, but we were a very large group--at least ten.
Half a block from an entrance to the park, a chaser came out of nowhere and rushed us.
The others turned and fled, but I ran straight at him, slipping past him into the street and around a car at the last second.
Rather than turn to pursue, he kept after the larger group.
Now alone, I made for the checkpoint.
A few feet shy of it, a chaser ran out of the gate and at me.
I hop-stepped back and again put a car between myself and her.
This time, though, I was alone.
\I've got patience
\So do I.'
\Ah
She went for him I went for the gate.
Another chaser came out from behind another car and dashed at me, but I beat him to the park in a madcap sprint.
Â 
I sat down to have my fortune told by the tellers in the middle of the park, and drew the Page of Wands.
Bex told me this was a good omen for a journey--the Page of Wands stands for taking risks, and finding adventure.
I grinned wide and agreed that it was an excellent and appropriate card for tonight.
And, indeed, it foreshadowed the rest of the night quite well.
I found Polin and Ben Gould wandering the checkpoint, still alive.
Unfortunately, just after I found them, Greg, Reed, Nichoel, and Savage came in--sporting their orange bands all too visibly.
There was a very awkward exchange.
Reed wanted me to stick with them, which I pointed out was obviously very silly.
They were now chasers, and I yet a runner.
Reed: Well, you still have my licorice in your bag.
::shakes head and hands back licorice:: See, Reed, this is what I'm in it for!
Polin: You're in it for licorice?
Me: No, you fool!
I'm in it for ADVENTURE!
With this established, Gould, Polin, a fellow named Brad, and I departed, leaving through the opposite exit of the park as our friends.
We wandered through the hills for a long while, heading towards Checkpoint Two.
We had a number of close calls, and tons of fun panicking over whether or not other groups were chasers or fellow runners.
I also picked up a large dried palm frond I found on a sidewalk, and carried it with me.
Hey, I figured, it might come in handy at some point.
A number of dives behind cars and into bushes later, we made it into the park, and the safety of the second Checkpoint.
After getting our manifests signed by the extremely well-dressed fisherman, we started planning for the next leg.
Checkpoint Three was at the far end of the lake, and as swimming was out of the question, we were left with Lakeshore.
A wide-open road with almost no side roads.
We toyed with taking a bus down it, but couldn't find a schedule for Saturday, and weren't sure if it still ran.
Our first attempt to go above Lakeshore looped back down onto it when our wooded path dead-ended into a fence.
Ben Gould put his head up defiantly and walked straight down Lakeshore undaunted.
He wasn't more than six feet down it when the man sitting at the bus stop bench next to him leapt at him, exposing the orange armband.
I didn't stop to see what happened, instead turning back and sprinting the way I'd come.
I later found out that Gould got away from that one, but one of our other friends, Tom, a chaser, tracked him down halfway to Checkpoint Five.
Polin wasn't so lucky, and got taken down right there.
I now found myself alone, with just my trusty palm frond--which took that moment to jab me viciously in the finger.
So now I was alone and bleeding, with just my traitorous palm frond.
I decided to keep it with me anyway, as I had a feeling it was about to very useful.
A trio of chasers passed me by, walking casually and calmly on foot, and didn't notice, so I decided to follow them down Lakeshore.
It was dark enough that armbands were barely visible, so they might get mistaken for runners and draw out potential ambushes.
I made it a good three blocks in safety, but then a girl leapt at me from barely two feet ahead, from inside a huge bush.
I threw my frond at her feet, and she recoiled, stopping her momentum hard and giving me the narrow lead I needed to break into a dead sprint.
I didn't even slow to look back until I'd made it the full three blocks back the way I'd come.
She was nowhere in sight, thanks to my palm frond.
I vowed never to forget its noble sacrifice, and began pondering another route.
At this point, I saw another runner, alone like me.
His name was Tyler, and he too had lost all six of his original compatriots.
I explained the situation on Lakeshore, and he agreed it was far too dangerous to risk it a third time.
We backpacked WAY back past Checkpoint Two, and then looped into the high hills.
I wasn't sure if he was leading me into an ambush, though--if all of his friends were chasers, what if he was working with them as bait, like Reed had wanted me to do for him?
He seemed so confident, not bothering to look down alleyways or between cars as he walked.
So I made sure to always lag half a block behind him, scouting much more cautiously.
His navigation worked, though, as we made our way through the hills to the top of East 18th St.
, which was one long Safe Zone all the way down into Checkpoint Three from above.
At Three we met up with his friends Britney, Bryce, Steven, and J Tony, who had in fact survived.
As it happened, they were all experienced SF0 players (or \Zerians\' as Bryce called them)
I decided to stick with them, figuring my chances were much better in a group than on my own.
Besides, Tyler had gotten me this far.
After some deliberation and planning with the map, we headed back up E18th, and over and down through Laney College.
Again we hit the top of a Safe Zone and followed it all the way into Checkpoint Four.
Along the way I found and picked up another dried palm frond, in memory of how well the first one had served me.
Checkpoint Four was a classical labyrinth, chalked onto a park blacktop.
I passed deep into it, informed the Lady of the Labyrinth that my favorite word was \defenestration
There, I did great and terrible battle with a minotaur, armed with my trusty frond.
With its help, I snatched the ring from its nose, and earned my freedom.
I left the way I came, and got my fourth manifest stamp.
We ran into the other Zerians' lost friend, Danielle, who had been tagged earlier, but was deciding to opt-out of most of the rest of the game rather than don her orange permanently.
We heard that the area between us and Five was swarmed with chasers, so we sat down for a bit of a rest before heading out.
We had Danielle walk a block ahead of us, keeping a lookout for any chasers.
We made it in total safety down to 2nd St.
, the next safe zone, and followed the train tracks down to Jack London Sq.
This turned out to be a rather large area, and we wandered for a good ten minutes looking for the Checkpoint.
At this point we were actually starting to run into the time limit--we made it to Checkpoint Five a bare ten minutes before they were scheduled to shut down.
There we had to spot twelve differences between two scenes of an office desk.
Working as a team, we quickly scoured the setups and found a solid number.
Some were easy--different colors of candles.
Some were subtler--Bryce discovered the skittles in the bowls were different flavors.
Our twelfth and final was noticing that one desk had, buried in a holder, a floppy disk full of PRON, whereas the other had a floppy disk full of PORN.
We all got our fifth manifest signatures.
Waiting for us on a nearby bench were the fortunetellers from the first Checkpoint, armed with one of the glorious and legendary Red Umbrellas.
Bex declared (due to mild claustrophobia) that she was officially extending the safety zone granted by it to a full five meters.
Now confident and safe, we trekked the mile or so to Checkpoint Six casually and proudly.
Along the way, Bryce earned a new nickname.
The thirteen-year-old (who looks a good three years older than he is) is now known by his initials--JB.
Yes, he's stuck as jailbait for the next five years.
I told him to enjoy it while it lasts.
At Checkpoint Six, we had to tell a carnie a joke he hadn't heard before.
I told Rancid's joke about the cat outside his window, only with the frond standing in for Rancid's flail.
obviously the joke fell on deaf ears, but hey, I'm not exactly a ringleader.
Cut me some slack.
It was now midnight, which meant that any remaining un-exhausted Chasers would be at Checkpoint Seven, our final destination.
This meant we had a terrifying and madcap rush ahead of us.
We took a paranoid stroll to a nearby BART station, where we hid out and waited for the 51 bus to arrive.
We hopped aboard, senses still VERY much aware and alert.
Halfway there, J Tony realized the last BART to SF was soon, so he and JB hopped off early to get home in time, sadly just shy of the end.
We know in our hearts they finished, though.
We arrived a few blocks from the park, and the last of us--Tyler, Britney, Steven, and I--prepared for our final mad dash to the finish line.
It turned out to be an easy stroll, though, and we walked into the park unaccosted.
As we learned, apparently the chasers had gotten tired and started heading home as early as 11:30, so all our waiting and planning had paid off.
After an exuberant (but brief) celebration, and the distributing of my pastries to the assembled victors, I called up Nichoel, who (along with Reed and Tom) got back out of bed and drove over and picked me up.
Mad props to them for that.
All in all, I had an absolutely fantastic Journey.
The first half was through a city I knew, with friends, but marked with adrenaline, the thrill of the chase, sprinting, and the evening heat of fire.
The second half was through an unfamiliar and dark underbelly, allied with mysterious strangers, run through with wit, cunning, planning, paranoia, and the night's cold of ice.
I acquired new skills, earned a badge of triump, made new friends, had epic adventures, proved myself against the night, and gained a newfound appreciation for palm fronds.
Thanks for the Journey, friends, and here's to many more.
Juliette:
I am sorry to tell you, dear SFÃ?ers, that I have no photographic evidence of my participation WAIT NO, I can take pictures of my ribbon and manifest!
, so I shallBut I will still be painfully thorough in describing my Journey adventures.
I do, however, have a well-creased, slightly dirty Manifest with seven marks of approval.
That's right, I made it all the way to the Shakespeare Garden (where, concidentaly, I was earlier today!
) as a Player.
Other members of my group were not so fortunate, but let me begin at the beginning.
From 0 to 1b
I arrived at this year's Journey with my lovely male companion, Mitchell, and his equally devastating sister.
(Man, something about that family!
Good genes.
) She, Hazel, played the night with a group of her friends, while Mitchell and I met up with some of his: Harry, Jia, and Eugene.
We five played a few rounds of Contact (a word game, for those who might not know) before the start and decided to head for Checkpoint 1b on foot.
We headed north throuth the Embarcadero Center and up to Jackson and Davis.
We used that lovely little skyway next to the Safeway to overshoot Jackson in our eagerness to avoid chasers, and walked/jogged up through what Google Maps tells me is called Sydney G.
Walton Square.
Then up Pacific to Columbus, where we turned south and walked down Columbus into the safe zone.
From there it was mostly a matter of following the crowd of players up to Portsmouth Square.
(This really bothered me: On the Manifest, Checkpoint 1b is called \Chinatown Park at Clay and Kearney.'
It has a proper name!
)
From 1b to 2
Getting out of 1b was a lot easier than we expected.
After my fiasco last year with chasers surrounding the area after Checkpoint 1, I was expecting to have to really stick to the shadows, but we reached the bus stop at Stockton and Sacramento with only a false alarm or two.
My group hopped a 30 down to 4th and Mission, only having to walk one block into the safe zone.
(We didn't know we could have waited a stop and gotten off into safe territory.
No harm done.
) By this point, I was starting to get nervous.
We hadn't had nearly enough trouble, I felt, and was worried that it would soon come our way in droves.
Alright, I can't keep detailing every little thing.
We went through Checkpoints 2-5 without very much trouble.
We talked to some nice chasers on a bus, then had to wait for them to give up on us to get to checkpoint 3, I believe.
Some other stuff happened.
We did clothing-swapping at checkpoint 3, although we switched back after because mine ended up a little bit too sexy (read: revealing) for the cold night despite all the running about.
Playing through checkpoint 4 was neat.
We drank the kool-aid at checkpoint 5, and I had a small fangirl-moment at recognizing LincÃ¸ln.
And so on.
It was fun, then scary stuff happened!
Supine:
The Battle of Buena Vista:
Coming out of checkpoint 5 in Duboce Park, we knew that we would have a problem.
Though the distance between Duboce and the Panhandle was negligible compared to that between any other checkpoints, this meant the greatest density of Chasers.
We also found ourselves coming up against the hilly, twisted backbone of San Francisco.
An initial plan to dart from bus stop to bus stop along Haight was quickly scrapped for this reason.
Instead, we decided to sneak as far up the hill as possible and use the force of gravity to propel us down the hill, straight into the safezone.
We slipped across the tracks and into Davies' Medical Center's abandoned parking lot.
Through this conduit, we traveled a block or two out of the direct path between checkpoints, in keeping with our previous strategy.
Walking up 14th, we five felt reasonably confident that we had evaded the Chasers, and even guaranteed ourselves a leisurely walk up the hill, which we could follow with a mad downhill dash right into the heart of Checkpoint 6.
Complacency is dangerous.
Crossing a street, we found ourselves nearly face to face with some other night walkers.
I even raised a hand in greeting before spying the three yellow ribbons tied around their arms.
The Chasers seemed equally surprised, but the wild smile that broke out on the middle chaser's face assured us that no mercy would be found.
Everyone moved at once.
I darted around the Chasers, and high-tailed it up the hill behind them, not daring to slow even enough to throw a glance over my shoulder.
I have no idea what happened to the others.
Perhaps Juliette can fill you in, as she ran nearly the opposite direction.
What I do know is that when I came back to myself, I had run five blocks along Buena Vista Terrace and Roosevelt way and found myself in the shadow of the Randall Museum.
I hunkered down behind some convenient shrubbery and attempted to reestablish contact with my party.
I ticked them off a mental list.
Eugene, down.
Harry, down.
Jia, down.
Three more chasers wandering about.
Harry helpfully offered that Juliette had escaped, and was now at the 24 Divis bus stop at 14th.
Sensing a trap, I told him I had run the opposite direction and said I would be down momentarily.
Thankfully, my friends were not as unscrupulous in their pursuit of runners as I assumed, and after waiting for them run off, I rejoined Juliette.
Juliette again:
More Buena Vista, my perspective
My greatest strength in running Journey is that I know San Francisco really, really well, especially MUNI.
So I knew that there was a bus stop with a shelter at 14th and Castro, that it was two blocks straight downhill to there from where we ran into the chasers, and that I was absolutely terrified and disarmed by the massive grin the right-hand chaser threw at me.
But these things passed so rapidly through my mind that I could hardly even register them, so mostly I just ran downhill.
I was hoping that our group would scatter in all directions and that the chasers would follow any pair or group instead of a lone girl with the edge of downhill momentum.
I don't know what happened to the other four, but my guess from reading Mitchell's account is that he went uphill, I went downhill, and Harry, Jia, and Eugene took the flatter cross-street at the intersection where this went down, and the chasers figured they had the best chances at us on more even ground.
Anyway, I essentially crashed down the hill into the safety of the bus stop, waited five minutes until I figured everyone would have been tagged or gotten away, and went to call my running-mates.
I discovered the same thing as Mitchell: he and I were the only to survive.
Harry, now a chaser, waved to me from across the street.
Mitchell eventually came to find me at the bus stop.
Our group decimated, Mitchell and I discussed with the others by phone what to do, and eventually decided that Mitchell and I would keep running as chasers without them.
And then, after that.
More stuff happened.
We went over to Checkpoint 6, and soon after ran into ananas, an old schoolmate!
We took the bus together to the party in the Shakespeare Garden.
We made it!
And then other things happened.
We listened to Corpus Callosum tell us that we were all going to get sick and die (one of these days), then we went with some other people and got some doughnuts, then we went back to Mitchell and Hazel's neck of the woods, and I slept over 'cause it was like 4am and I didn't want to wait alone for an hour for a bus or call a cab.
And we had french toast the next morning, and it was really good.
OKAY GUYS, NOW LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
Intro and Rules
We moved into active planning mode back in April, after MN0 players had returned from Chicago with tales of adventure.
I had wanted to have the event here in the Twin Cities since at least 2007, when they did the  Journey:Glasnost event in San Francisco.
The reports from that just charged me with desire.
But it was all very loose until the rest of the folks came back from Chicago fired up.
So I asked if people would be willing to build the thing together and make it happen.
We lined up a small team of people to make group decisionsâ??Dok Harmon, JJason, Ink Tea, OliverX, Star5, and meâ??and moved the thing forward.
We did a lot of email and had some meetings, we built some google documents, and we debated what we wanted to do.
Here's a set of google docs we put together and discussed planning: 
First a clearing house that had a lot of loose discussion and plans.
Then a rules doc to discuss our hopes and ideas for making it interesting.
This rules document  was later condensed into a final rules doc.
I offer these as a look at some of our planning process.
I don't mind being a 'take charge' leader type, but honestly I get plenty of opportunities in other areas of my life.
I wanted us to feel like we could all contribute and work within consensus, with each person feeling able to add (not to mention being able to make decisions at game time).
By and large I think this happened, though you can check in with the other players in the bunch.
I think MN0 as a group has some interesting things to move forward with anyways, and lessons learned.
Route and Map
 Crucial to the planning process was the route.
I had scoped out routes and locations around the twin cities a lot over the second half of 2007.
Some of the pieces of that research made it into the final route, but ultimately that was a group decision.
The Final Map is really a living document, which has a lot of points on it that were discussed and not used.
When you review it, the Stage Points are in blue with a black dot, the pinkish points are bonus checkpoints (unstaffed), and the purple points are points that were discussed but not used.
The line is useful as a kind of 'best case scenario' for how long the route was if someone took it straight from stage to stage, without being pursued, without taking the bonus checkpoints, or without jumping public transportation.
It would have been about six and a half miles to run this theoretical course.
Here's the other map ideas:
version 1
version 2
version 3 which almost definitely required rail travel
version 4 which had some issues of safety maybe?
here's a what if we did it in St.
version
here's some experiments
here is a length test of SF's Journey:Glasnost, which I studied along with the others to determine how long it might be to work best.
They had a good shorter one for the second version, and I kinda liked that.
Communications
 We did a lot of emailing back and forth.
Here's a sample of some of the decision making: On Sep 3, 2008, at 6:27 PM, Craig Daniel wrote:
A week and a half to go, and Spidere has to bail on us.
Anyone got any thoughts on filling up our now-even-emptier checkpoint
agent roster?
As mentioned at the start of this week, we have the following staff:
Chasers
Craig
Oliver
Star5
Ink
Checkpoints
0 JonO - deep breath and push
1 (working on someone, open to suggestions)- childhood
2 (maybe Laura, that's who I'm working on today) - adolescence
3 spidere dropped out!
  - adulthood
4  (no one yet) - middle age
5  JJason - old age
6  JonO death!
Well, I think we're going to have to ask a couple folks to set aside their preferences for the greater good.
My first hope is that we can ask Star5 to help.
Can you staff a checkpoint?
Because she's indicated some flexibility, I've asked Laura (MJ9) today if she can work checkpoint instead of magic running.
We'll see.
One of our 'magic runner' recruits is Loki (Erik).
His flight from SF is booked and he's coming.
If we have to, we can ask him to staff.
So that's three people I believe can be .
persuaded.
which would bring our number to 5 of the 6 actual warm bodies needed (I double up to cover 0 and 6).
My original idea for recruiting was hopefully to get people with children to staff checkpoint 1.
I wanted to ask Beverly Penn (Nicole) to bring her daughter June.
I hoped to bring Eleanor and Henry as well, but I don't know because Leann has mentioned some family plans that evening.
So I don't have someone there
SO this is what I see, if we can't add people to the list and our 'please help friends out please' request is effective:
0 JonO - deep breath and push
1 - childhood
2 MJ9?
- adolescence
3 Star5?
- adulthood
4  Loki?
- middle age
5  JJason - old age
6  JonO death!
Thoughts?
Love,
Jon
PS Here's what I said about ribbon:

There's actual pricing here:
http://www.
jkmribbonandtrims.
com/searchresult.
CategoryID=397
Two things:
 1) I don't know how much to buy.
Spidere budgeted 1.
5 feet per person for 300 people (and that many showed up!
) I don't know that we'll have anywhere near that number.
However, if we're short, there's not exactly any place we can go nearby to purchase dozens of yards of ribbon at the last minute.
Thoughts?
2) I can afford to buy 100 yards of each at JKM's prices.
I don't have a ton of money to spare right now, so I know I can't afford 400 yards total.
Anyone want to chip in?
Corollary to that: anyone know of another place you can buy bulk ribbon cheaper?
We should move on this early this week while there's still enough time to get it here if we buy online.
That's just an example.
I count over 200 messages since April related to Journey to the End of the Night between the planners.
It's probably more than 300.
Lots of little details.
I needlessly worried over ribbon, by the end.
It was kind of ridiculous how distracting I let ribbons become.
Promotion
 We put in a group effort to promote it, with good graphic design from Star5, and considerable effort to get info into the hands of the press, as well as direct promotion and social networking.
We all made phone calls and social networking outreach.
We sent a lot of emails to our friends and relatives.
I wrote a press release and submitted it on repeat occasions to the big city newspapers, to City Pages, and fifteen community newspapers in our area.
I also got help from Susy Derkins to translate it into EspaÃ±ol which we submitted to three area Spanish-language community papers.
The press efforts did get  some notice, including a story in The Bridge, and some of the releases got printed wholesale (including my phone number!
) in papers.
And I got about five phone calls from strangers who read it in their paper and wanted to know more.
That was cool.
We also worked up the MNZero website.
I did some infrastructure work on other fronts too, with a minnesotazero gmail address, created an mnzero twitter account to help with short info if people wanted it and got a MailChimp account for minnesotazero so we could also send trackable html emails and have an automated mailing list manager.
Future MNZero events can (and some will) use these organs as well (I'm going to share the admin information with those people, obviously).
There are also existing resources through Waste, which the PuzzleQuests have used already, and presumably will continue to use.
These are just a nice addition to the .
portfolio.
of tools we can use to promote future events.
Runners and Race Day
The numbers of rsvp's we had through the website, through direct conversations, and social networks gave us a sense that there might be as many as 80.
So many people these days fail to rsvp (or note they are coming) that I think we might have expected 100 people or so.
At least it was looking that way.
Of course it rained.
It rained like cats and dogs all damn day!
We had right around 60 runners, and on the basis of the noise and activity we saw late in the promotion process, I truly believe we would have almost doubled that number but for the rain.
This is spectacular in my opinion.
Yes, it's not Chicago's impressive 200 or DC's ridiculous 300.
But we are a smaller city.
It could be pointed out there is no 'public free games scene' to speak of in Minneapolis/St.
Paul, and getting a handle on the 'audience base' for this kind of event is still up in the air.
Or to be more precise, we are that scene for the moment.
Seeing the steady growth MN0 events have had since May is very encouraging.
But it's all good.
We also learned late in the process that City Pages (the local arts weekly with a readership of a couple hundred thousand) has a bug in their calendar submission form.
We submitted via web (though also through a traditional hard copy press release I point out), and Ink Tea worked over her very solid connection with one of their writers.
I finally heard back from their editor who said if their website hadn't messed up our event submission we would have been A-Listed (the A-List is their events calendar that truly does have a measurable impact on turnout at local events).
There was a lot of discussion about rules tweaks, as well as discussion about the level of difficulty in the course.
We settled the last stage details on Thursday night/Friday morning.
We got, then lost one, then weren't sure about a couple, then nailed down all of our stage agents by Friday.
We got ribbon (and then more ribbon, and some backup ribbon, and who knows how much extra ribbon?
) We got a decent sized bunch of staff chasers, and had all the printing and planning and bonus stage primping done by Saturday afternoon.
It rained all day on Saturday.
First in fits and starts, then in gallons, then stopped, then it pissed down for a while and stopped.
Then it started again.
At 4, I was beside myself.
Though I spent the day keeping my chin up and my attitude with others cheerful and excited, I was barely a functional adult and very close to brimming with tears as I showered and changed, and loaded up my in-laws' van with a soap box for standing, a table and tent for stage three, and the desk for stage four (I shoulda took out th' drawers!
As I drove to pick up the manifest/map printouts, I saw sun through the clouds.
As I plopped the printouts into a box, the rain stopped.
After I put the waivers through the paper cutter,  the streets looked a little dryer.
I loaded up the final touches and headed for the starting line, and began to get into character.
